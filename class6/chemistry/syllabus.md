## Theme 2: Elements, Compounds and Mixtures

### 1) Element  
*A substance made up of identical atoms.*

- Use of symbols as shorthand notations for writing names of elements  
- Origin of symbols of elements  
- Names and symbols of the first 20 elements  
- Molecules of elements contain atoms of the same element (O₂, N₂, H₂)  

### 2) Compound  
*Two or more elements combine in fixed definite proportions to form a compound. Original properties of the constituent elements are lost and a substance with new properties is formed.*

- Molecules of compounds contain atoms of different elements (H₂O, CO₂, NO₂, CaO, ZnCl₂)  

### 3) Mixture  
*Components of more than one substance combine in any proportion. Original properties of the components are retained.*

### 4) Difference between mixtures and compounds  
- Based on proportion of combination of components and their properties  

### 5) Separation techniques of mixtures into their components
- Sieving  
- Sedimentation  
- Decantation  
- Filtration  
- Evaporation  
- Magnetic separation  
- Sublimation

## Theme 3: Matter

### States of Matter
- Classification of matter into solid, liquid and gas on the basis of properties (shape, volume)  
- Factors responsible for the existence of matter in different states  
- Arrangement of atoms/molecules in solids, liquids and gases (intermolecular space, cohesive forces)  
- There is space between the particles of matter  
- Effect of heat on matter (expansion, change of state and chemical change)

## Theme 4: Water
- Importance of water in everyday life (household purpose, industry, watering plants, etc.)  
- Water resources (well, river, hand pump, lakes, pond, etc.)  
- Capacity of water to dissolve many salts  
- Definition of solute, solvent and solution  
- Importance of water for sustenance of life on Earth  
- Reasons for water pollution; its prevention and conservation of water

## Theme 5: Air and Atmosphere
- Air is present everywhere around us  
- Air as a mixture of gases: nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapour; dust and smoke as pollutants  
- Percentage composition of air  
- Uses of the components present (importance of nitrogen to plants)  
- Definition of atmosphere as a layer of air around the Earth
