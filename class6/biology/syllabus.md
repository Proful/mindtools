### The Flower
- Parts (4 whorls), structure and function of each whorl  
- Pollination (self and cross): idea about agents of cross-pollination (wind, water and insects – with examples)  
- Fertilization: process in simple terms  
- Formation of fruit – fate of each part (whorl) of flower after fertilization  
- Parts of fruits:  
  - Dry and fleshy fruits  
  - Examples of dry and fleshy fruits  
  - Parts of the pericarp of fleshy fruits (epicarp, mesocarp, endocarp) and function of each part  
- Seed – parts (cotyledon, embryo: radicle, plumule) and types (monocot, dicot)  
- Germination – conditions required for germination (moisture, warmth); seed germination of different seeds
