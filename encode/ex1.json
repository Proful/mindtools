    "question": "What is force?",
    "options": ["A push or pull", "How heavy", "Speed up", "Change direction"],
    "correct_answer": "A push or pull",
    "explanation": "Force is defined as a push or pull that can make things move, stop, or change direction."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does mass tell us about an object?",
    "options": ["How fast it moves", "How heavy it is", "Its color", "Its shape"],
    "correct_answer": "How heavy it is",
    "explanation": "Mass is a measure of how heavy an object is, regardless of its size."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when you apply more force to a toy car?",
    "options": ["It slows down", "It stops", "It speeds up", "It gets heavier"],
    "correct_answer": "It speeds up",
    "explanation": "Applying more force to a toy car will increase its speed or acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "If two objects have the same size but different masses, which one is harder to move?",
    "options": ["The lighter one", "The heavier one", "Both are the same", "Depends on color"],
    "correct_answer": "The heavier one",
    "explanation": "An object with more mass requires more force to move or accelerate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is acceleration?",
    "options": ["A push", "How heavy", "Speeding up or slowing down", "A shape"],
    "correct_answer": "Speeding up or slowing down",
    "explanation": "Acceleration refers to a change in speed or direction."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the formula 'Force = Mass × Acceleration' tell us?",
    "options": [
      "Force increases with more mass or acceleration",
      "Mass decreases with more force",
      "Acceleration is not related to mass",
      "Force and mass are unrelated"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Force increases with more mass or acceleration",
    "explanation": "The formula shows that force is directly proportional to both mass and acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does a heavy car require more force to move than a toy car?",
    "options": [
      "It is smaller",
      "It has less mass",
      "It has more mass",
      "It is lighter"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "It has more mass",
    "explanation": "A heavier car has more mass, so more force is needed to move it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What will happen if you push a ball and a brick with the same force?",
    "options": [
      "Both will move the same distance",
      "The ball will move farther",
      "The brick will move farther",
      "Neither will move"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "The ball will move farther",
    "explanation": "The ball has less mass, so it accelerates more with the same force."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you stop pedaling your bike, what happens to the acceleration?",
    "options": ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It reverses"],
    "correct_answer": "It decreases",
    "explanation": "When you stop pedaling, there is less force applied, so the bike slows down (negative acceleration)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What connects force, mass, and acceleration?",
    "options": [
      "Newton’s Law",
      "Gravity",
      "Friction",
      "Color"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Newton’s Law",
    "explanation": "Newton’s second law of motion explains how force, mass, and acceleration are related."
