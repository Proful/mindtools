    <h1>SKELETAL SYSTEM</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      The skeletal system is one of the most important organ systems in the
      human body. It is made mostly of bones which form the framework for the
      human body.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were born with around 270 bones. But as you grow, some of these bones
      fuse together. The skeleton of an adult human has 206 bones. The largest
      bone in the body is the thigh bone (femur) and the smallest bone (stapes)
      is found in the ear.
    </p>
    <h2>THE SKELETAL SYSTEM</h2>
    <p>Functions of the Skeletal System</p>
    <p>
      The functions of the skeletal system in the human body are as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The skeletal system is the framework for the body. You can stand up
        straight because of the skeleton.
      </li>
      <li>It gives shape to the body.</li>
      <li>It helps the body to move from place to place.</li>
      <li>
        It supports and protects soft organs like the heart and the brain from
        being hurt or damaged.
      </li>
      <li>
        The bone marrow (found inside some bones) produces the RBCs, WBCs and
        platelets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Parts of the Skeletal System</h3>
    <p>
      The bones that are found in each part of the body are of different shape
      and size.
    </p>
    <h4>The skull - 22 bones</h4>
    <p>
      The bones found in the head form the skull. The skull is made of 22 bones
      - eight bones form the head (cranium or brain-case) and 14 bones form the
      face. The only bone that can move in the skull is the lower jawbone which
      helps you to talk, eat and chew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions The skull protects your brain from being harmed. It also
      supports the sensory organs such as the eyes, ears and nose, and provides
      space for your teeth.
    </p>
    <h4>The backbone 33 bones</h4>
    <p>
      The backbone or spine is made of 33 bones called the vertebrae (singular:
      vertebra). It is also called the vertebral column and is connected to the
      skull. Each vertebra has a hole in the middle through which the delicate
      spinal cord (a bundle of nerves) passes. The last five vertebrae are fused
      to form the tail bone or the coccyx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions The vertebral column helps you to stand up straight or erect. It
      protects the spinal cord from being hurt.
    </p>
    <h4>The ribcage</h4>
    <p>
      The ribcage is in the chest. It is made of 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a
      slender, curved bone. The top seven pairs of ribs (called true ribs) are
      attached to the spine at the back and to the breastbone or the sternum in
      the front with cartilage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eighth, ninth and tenth pairs of ribs are attached to the cartilage of
      the seventh pair of ribs. Unlike the first seven pairs, they are not
      directly attached to the sternum and so are called false ribs. The
      eleventh and twelfth pairs of ribs are not attached to the sternum and are
      called floating ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions The ribcage forms a cage that protects the heart, lungs,
      diaphragm, liver, stomach and the kidneys. The space that is enclosed by
      the ribcage is called the thoracic cavity.
    </p>
    <h4>The girdles</h4>
    <p>The shoulder girdle is made of the collarbone and the shoulder blade.</p>
    <p>
      Functions The shoulder girdle connects the arms to the rest of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pelvic girdle is a ring of bones that supports the weight of the upper
      body. It is made of the hip bones, which are attached to the sacrum (a
      part of the backbone).
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions The pelvic girdle connects the legs to the rest of the body. It
      also protects the lower part of the digestive tract, the urinary bladder
      and the reproductive organs.
    </p>
    <h4>Diaphragm</h4>
    <p>
      The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle found below the lungs. It plays an
      important role in breathing. It helps to increase the area inside the
      chest so that air can enter the lungs.
    </p>
    <h4>The limbs</h4>
    <p>
      The arms Each arm includes the upper arm, the lower arm, wrist and hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper arm contains the humerus, and the lower arm contains the ulna
      and the radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each hand contains 27 bones—8 bones in the wrist and 19 bones in the palm
      and fingers.
    </p>
    <h4>The legs</h4>
    <p>
      Each leg includes the upper leg or thigh, the lower leg, ankle and foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thigh contains the femur, and the lower leg contains the tibia (shin
      bone) and fibula (calf bone). The kneecap or patella is found over the
      knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each foot contains 26 bones—7 bones in the ankle and 19 bones in the rest
      of the foot.
    </p>
    <h4>The Structure of Bones</h4>
    <p>
      The bones are some of the hardest structures in the body. However, they
      are soft on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the long bones in your body have a hollow space in the middle that
      is filled with a soft jelly-like substance called bone marrow.
    </p>
    <p>Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow.</p>
    <h4>Cartilage</h4>
    <p>
      The cartilage is a tough, elastic substance usually found between two
      bones. It acts as a shock absorber and prevents the bones from rubbing
      against each other, thus wearing them out and causing pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cartilage is found at the ends of bones in joints, the tip of your nose,
      the ear lobe and so on.
    </p>
    <h3>Joints</h3>
    <p>
      The place where two bones meet is called a joint. A joint may be fixed
      (immovable), slightly movable or freely movable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joints between the bones of the skull are fixed while the joints
      between the vertebrae are slightly movable. The bones in a joint are held
      together by ligaments which are thick elastic bands of tissue.
    </p>
    <h4>Pivot joint</h4>
    <p>
      In this type of joint, one of the bones rotates within a ring-like
      structure formed by the other bone. This allows movement around an axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of joint is found between the first and second vertebrae. It
      helps you to move your head up and down, and side to side. It is also
      found in the arm where the radius and ulna meet at the elbow.
    </p>
    <h4>Hinge joint</h4>
    <p>
      This type of joint allows back-and-forth movement similar to the opening
      and closing of a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of joint is found in your elbow, knee, fingers and toes. It
      allows you to fold your arm, bend your knee, and to bend or flex your
      fingers and toes.
    </p>
    <h4>Ball-and-socket joint</h4>
    <p>
      In this type of joint, the rounded edge of one bone fits into the hollow
      end of another. This allows the bone to be moved in nearly all directions.
    </p>
    <h4>Gliding joint</h4>
    <p>
      This type of joint is found between the flat surfaces of two bones that
      are held together by ligaments.<br />The ends of the bones can slide over
      each other, thus allowing side-to-side as well as backward and forward
      movement. This type of joint is found in your wrists and ankles along with
      other joints.
    </p>
    <h3>THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM</h3>
    <p>
      The bones cannot move by themselves. They are pulled by muscles. Muscles
      are made of thick elastic tissues. They are attached to the bones through
      tough bands of tissue called tendons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The muscles can only pull the bones and not push them. This is why your
      body uses two muscles to make a bone move—one to pull it in one direction
      and the other to pull it in the opposite direction.<br />Thus, a pair of
      muscles works together by contracting and relaxing to move a bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see this by taking the example of our upper arm muscles. The biceps
      and the triceps are the muscles found in the upper arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the biceps contracts, the triceps relaxes.<br />This results in the
      lower arm moving towards the upper arm. You have folded your arm.<br />When
      the biceps relaxes, the triceps contracts.<br />This results in the lower
      arm moving away from the upper arm. You have straightened your arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Types of Muscles in Your Body<br />Muscles are classified into three
      main types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardiac muscles This type of muscle is found only in the heart. It helps
      the heart work continuously without a break. The body cannot control the
      cardiac muscles. They are involuntary muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smooth muscles This type of muscle is found in the digestive system, blood
      vessels and so on. These are also involuntary muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skeletal muscles This type of muscle is attached to the bones through
      tendons. They help in movement. These muscles are the only type of muscle
      that your body can control. They are voluntary muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking Care of the Bones<br />Eat a balanced diet that is rich in calcium
      to build strong bones and to maintain their strength throughout your life.
      Sesame seeds, milk, yogurt, salmon, beans, almonds, figs, spinach and kale
      are some good sources of calcium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vitamin D is also needed to absorb calcium. It is produced in the body on
      exposure to sunlight. Seafood, liver, cheese, egg yolks and mushrooms
      contain some amounts of this vitamin.
    </p>
    <p>Exercise also strengthens bones</p>
