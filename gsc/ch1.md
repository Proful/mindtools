# Human Body

## INTRODUCTION

Our body has many organs that carry out different functions. Our eyes help us to see what is around us. Our legs help us to move from place to place. Some organs work along with other organs to carry out a particular function. A group of organs that work together forms an organ system.

The main organ systems in the human body

| Organ system        | Organs                                                              | Functions                                                        |

| Respiratory system  | nose, windpipe, lungs                                               | enables the taking in of oxygen and giving out of carbon dioxide |
| Digestive system    | mouth, food pipe, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum | digests the food and rids the body of waste                      |

| Muscular system     | muscles                                                             | enables the body to move                                         |
| Nervous system      | brain, spinal cord, nerves                                          | controls all the organs and organ systems in the body            |
| Reproductive system | different organs in males and females                               | helps in reproduction                                            |

## THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

The circulatory system consists of blood, the blood vessels and the heart.

The circulatory system helps to transport substances.

- It transports nutrients to all parts of the body.
- It transports oxygen to all the cells in the body.
- It transports waste from all parts of the body to the lungs, skin or kidneys to be excreted.

### Spotlight

Circulatory means 'that which goes around in a circle'. We say that blood circulates through the body. This means blood travels in a path through the body and comes back to the starting point.

### Blood

Blood is a liquid that flows through the body. It carries nutrients, dissolved substances, special proteins and also waste. It contains three main types of cells:

- red blood cells or RBCs that carry oxygen
- white blood cells or WBCs that protect the body against germs and other harmful substances
- platelets that help blood to clot

#### Functions of blood

- It carries oxygen to all parts of the body.
- It carries carbon dioxide from all parts of the body to the lungs.
- It transports nutrients to every part of the body.
- It transports waste from every part of the body to the lungs, skin or kidneys.
- It helps the body fight against germs and other harmful substances that enter the body.

### Blood Vessels

Blood vessels are tube-like structures that carry blood to all parts of the body. There are three main types of blood vessels in the body.

### Arteries

Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. They have thick, elastic walls. They are found deep inside the body and are not usually seen under the skin. The aorta is the largest artery in the body. The carotid artery supplies blood to the head.

### Veins

Veins carry oxygen-poor blood from the rest of the body to the heart. They have thinner walls than the arteries. They are located nearer to the surface of the skin and thus some of them can be seen. The superior vena cava carries blood from the head, neck, arms and chest, and the inferior vena cava carries blood from the abdomen and legs.

### Capillaries

These blood vessels connect the arteries and the veins. They have thin walls, about one cell thick. This helps the capillaries take oxygen to every cell and collect waste from every cell.

### Stop and check

Answer the following questions.

1. Name the organs of the circulatory system.
2. What is the function of platelets in our body?
3. Name the vein that carries blood from the legs to the heart.

### The Heart

The heart is a fist-sized, muscular organ found in the chest cavity, between the lungs. It pumps blood throughout the body.

The heart is divided into two halves by a thick muscular wall called the septum. Each half is further divided into an atrium (found at the top) and a ventricle (found at the bottom) which are connected to each other. The heart thus has four chambersâ€”two atria and two ventricles.

Blood can flow only from the atria to the ventricle because of the valves between them.

### Valve

A valve is a fold that opens in only one direction. Thus, valves allow blood to flow only in one direction. Most of them are found between the chambers of the heart and in some veins. The valves in the veins prevent the blood from flowing back and allow it to flow towards the heart.

Valve stopping blood from flowing backwards.

### The Flow of Blood through the Body

- In the lungs, carbon dioxide is given out and oxygen is taken in. The blood becomes oxygen-rich.
- The pulmonary veins bring the oxygen-rich blood to the left atrium.
- (Inside the heart) The left atrium contracts and pushes the blood into the left ventricle.
- (Inside the heart) The left ventricle contracts and pushes the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body through the aorta.
- The superior and inferior venae cavae bring oxygen-poor blood from the rest of the body to the right atrium.
- (Inside the heart) The right atrium contracts and pushes the blood into the right ventricle.
- (Inside the heart) The right ventricle contracts and pushes the blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.

### The heartbeat

The heart beats around 70 times a minute in an adult. It beats faster when one is active. It beats slower during deep sleep. The heart also beats faster in children than in adults.

The pulse, that is, the flow of blood through the blood vessels, can be felt by touching the body at certain places like the wrists or neck.

### Keeping the Heart Healthy

Eating certain kinds of fatty foods may lead to some of the fats being deposited on the inner walls of the arteries. This makes the arteries narrow. The heart has to work harder than usual to pump blood through these narrow blood vessels.

This narrowing of arteries can be prevented by following a healthy diet and regular exercise.

- Walk or cycle to school if it is near your home.
- Play an active sport like football or badminton.
- Use the stairs when possible instead of a lift.
- Do not eat too much fried food.

### Practising Yoga

Yoga is a good form of exercise that we can practise. It helps to keep the body fit and healthy. Some benefits of practising yoga are:

- It increases energy and improves memory and concentration.
- It improves flexibility, balance and lung function.
- It lowers blood pressure.
- It lowers the possibility of heart diseases.

Always practise yoga under the guidance of a trained yoga teacher or an expert.
