# SKELETAL SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION

The skeletal system is one of the most important organ systems in the human body. It is made mostly of bones which form the framework for the human body.

You were born with around 270 bones. But as you grow, some of these bones fuse together. The skeleton of an adult human has 206 bones. The largest bone in the body is the thigh bone (femur) and the smallest bone (stapes) is found in the ear.

## THE SKELETAL SYSTEM

Functions of the Skeletal System

The functions of the skeletal system in the human body are as follows.

- The skeletal system is the framework for the body. You can stand up straight because of the skeleton.
- It gives shape to the body.
- It helps the body to move from place to place.
- It supports and protects soft organs like the heart and the brain from being hurt or damaged.
- The bone marrow (found inside some bones) produces the RBCs, WBCs and platelets.

### Parts of the Skeletal System

The bones that are found in each part of the body are of different shape and size.

#### The skull - 22 bones

The bones found in the head form the skull. The skull is made of 22 bones - eight bones form the head (cranium or brain-case) and 14 bones form the face. The only bone that can move in the skull is the lower jawbone which helps you to talk, eat and chew.

Functions The skull protects your brain from being harmed. It also supports the sensory organs such as the eyes, ears and nose, and provides space for your teeth.

#### The backbone 33 bones

The backbone or spine is made of 33 bones called the vertebrae (singular: vertebra). It is also called the vertebral column and is connected to the skull. Each vertebra has a hole in the middle through which the delicate spinal cord (a bundle of nerves) passes. The last five vertebrae are fused to form the tail bone or the coccyx.

Functions The vertebral column helps you to stand up straight or erect. It protects the spinal cord from being hurt.

#### The ribcage

The ribcage is in the chest. It is made of 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a slender, curved bone. The top seven pairs of ribs (called true ribs) are attached to the spine at the back and to the breastbone or the sternum in the front with cartilage.

The eighth, ninth and tenth pairs of ribs are attached to the cartilage of the seventh pair of ribs. Unlike the first seven pairs, they are not directly attached to the sternum and so are called false ribs. The eleventh and twelfth pairs of ribs are not attached to the sternum and are called floating ribs.

Functions The ribcage forms a cage that protects the heart, lungs, diaphragm, liver, stomach and the kidneys. The space that is enclosed by the ribcage is called the thoracic cavity.

#### The girdles

The shoulder girdle is made of the collarbone and the shoulder blade.

Functions The shoulder girdle connects the arms to the rest of the body.

The pelvic girdle is a ring of bones that supports the weight of the upper body. It is made of the hip bones, which are attached to the sacrum (a part of the backbone).

Functions The pelvic girdle connects the legs to the rest of the body. It also protects the lower part of the digestive tract, the urinary bladder and the reproductive organs.

#### Diaphragm

The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle found below the lungs. It plays an important role in breathing. It helps to increase the area inside the chest so that air can enter the lungs.

#### The limbs

The arms Each arm includes the upper arm, the lower arm, wrist and hand.

The upper arm contains the humerus, and the lower arm contains the ulna and the radius.

Each hand contains 27 bones—8 bones in the wrist and 19 bones in the palm and fingers.

#### The legs

Each leg includes the upper leg or thigh, the lower leg, ankle and foot.

The thigh contains the femur, and the lower leg contains the tibia (shin bone) and fibula (calf bone). The kneecap or patella is found over the knee.

Each foot contains 26 bones—7 bones in the ankle and 19 bones in the rest of the foot.

#### The Structure of Bones

The bones are some of the hardest structures in the body. However, they are soft on the inside.

Many of the long bones in your body have a hollow space in the middle that is filled with a soft jelly-like substance called bone marrow.

Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow.

#### Cartilage

The cartilage is a tough, elastic substance usually found between two bones. It acts as a shock absorber and prevents the bones from rubbing against each other, thus wearing them out and causing pain.

Cartilage is found at the ends of bones in joints, the tip of your nose, the ear lobe and so on.

### Joints

The place where two bones meet is called a joint. A joint may be fixed (immovable), slightly movable or freely movable.

The joints between the bones of the skull are fixed while the joints between the vertebrae are slightly movable. The bones in a joint are held together by ligaments which are thick elastic bands of tissue.

#### Pivot joint

In this type of joint, one of the bones rotates within a ring-like structure formed by the other bone. This allows movement around an axis.

This type of joint is found between the first and second vertebrae. It helps you to move your head up and down, and side to side. It is also found in the arm where the radius and ulna meet at the elbow.

#### Hinge joint

This type of joint allows back-and-forth movement similar to the opening and closing of a door.

This type of joint is found in your elbow, knee, fingers and toes. It allows you to fold your arm, bend your knee, and to bend or flex your fingers and toes.

#### Ball-and-socket joint

In this type of joint, the rounded edge of one bone fits into the hollow end of another. This allows the bone to be moved in nearly all directions.

#### Gliding joint

This type of joint is found between the flat surfaces of two bones that are held together by ligaments.
The ends of the bones can slide over each other, thus allowing side-to-side as well as backward and forward movement. This type of joint is found in your wrists and ankles along with other joints.

### THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM

The bones cannot move by themselves. They are pulled by muscles. Muscles are made of thick elastic tissues. They are attached to the bones through tough bands of tissue called tendons.

The muscles can only pull the bones and not push them. This is why your body uses two muscles to make a bone move—one to pull it in one direction and the other to pull it in the opposite direction.
Thus, a pair of muscles works together by contracting and relaxing to move a bone.

Let us see this by taking the example of our upper arm muscles. The biceps and the triceps are the muscles found in the upper arm.

When the biceps contracts, the triceps relaxes.
This results in the lower arm moving towards the upper arm. You have folded your arm.
When the biceps relaxes, the triceps contracts.
This results in the lower arm moving away from the upper arm. You have straightened your arm.

The Types of Muscles in Your Body
Muscles are classified into three main types.

Cardiac muscles This type of muscle is found only in the heart. It helps the heart work continuously without a break. The body cannot control the cardiac muscles. They are involuntary muscles.

Smooth muscles This type of muscle is found in the digestive system, blood vessels and so on. These are also involuntary muscles.

Skeletal muscles This type of muscle is attached to the bones through tendons. They help in movement. These muscles are the only type of muscle that your body can control. They are voluntary muscles.

Taking Care of the Bones
Eat a balanced diet that is rich in calcium to build strong bones and to maintain their strength throughout your life. Sesame seeds, milk, yogurt, salmon, beans, almonds, figs, spinach and kale are some good sources of calcium.

Vitamin D is also needed to absorb calcium. It is produced in the body on exposure to sunlight. Seafood, liver, cheese, egg yolks and mushrooms contain some amounts of this vitamin.

Exercise also strengthens bones
