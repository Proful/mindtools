        <h2>Still Me by Christopher Reeve</h2>
        <p>
          This is the determined, passionate story of one man, a gifted actor 
          and star, and how he and his family came to grips with the kind of 
          devastating, unexplainable shock that fate can bring to any of us.

          They would set a target level and throw numbers at me, shouting, 
          “You’ve got to beat that number.” It was a simple exercise, but it 
          got me going. Each day I tried to beat the previous day’s numbers.

          At first it was a wholly new experience for me to try to move one 
          muscle at a time. It took a while for my brain to make a connection 
          with the muscle I wanted to move. I’d have to think: My brain to my 
          right shoulder. Okay, I just want that trapezius muscle at the top 
          of my right shoulder to move. All right, let’s go. One, two, three, 
          go. I would will it to move. Gradually, the numbers began to improve.

          I couldn’t give up, because additional recovery can occur after six 
          months, a year, even eighteen months, two years. That motivated me 
          to keep exercising. Nerves can find new pathways, new ways to 
          stimulate the muscles.

        <h2>Running on Empty by Guy Deacon</h2>
        <p>
          A powerful memoir about Deacon’s solo, 18,000-mile journey across 
          Africa in a VW camper van despite his stage three Parkinson's—an 
          inspiring story of courage, independence, and raising awareness.
