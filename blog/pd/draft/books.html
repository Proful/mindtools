        <h2>Still Me by Christopher Reeve</h2>
        <p>
          This is the determined, passionate story of one man, a gifted actor 
          and star, and how he and his family came to grips with the kind of 
          devastating, unexplainable shock that fate can bring to any of us. 
        </p>
        <p>
          They would set a target level and throw numbers at me, shouting, 
          “You’ve got to beat that number.” It was a simple exercise, but it 
          got me going. Each day I tried to beat the previous day’s numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At first it was a wholly new experience for me to try to move one 
          muscle at a time. It took a while for my brain to make a connection 
          with the muscle I wanted to move. I’d have to think: My brain to my 
          right shoulder. Okay, I just want that trapezius muscle at the top 
          of my right shoulder to move. All right, let’s go. One, two, three, 
          go. I would will it to move. Gradually, the numbers began to improve. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn’t give up, because additional recovery can occur after six 
          months, a year, even eighteen months, two years. That motivated me 
          to keep exercising. Nerves can find new pathways, new ways to 
          stimulate the muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was aware that if I allowed it to atrophy, I might never be able 
          to use it. 
          I decided I had to make another attempt to breathe on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was only able to draw in an average of 50 cc’s with each attempt. 
          But at least it was something. I had moved the dial.
          Dr asked me to take another ten breaths for a comparison with 
          yesterday’s numbers. I took the ten breaths, and my average for 
          each one was 450 cc’s. They couldn’t believe it. 
          I thought to myself: All right. Now we’re getting somewhere.
        </p>

          At the dinner table, when each of us in turn spoke a few words 
          about what we were thankful for, Will said, “Dad.”

          A psychologist at Kessler once said to me, 
          “Don’t turn your wife into your nurse or your mother.”

        <h2>A Monk's Guide to Happiness by Gelong Thubten</h2>
        <p>
          You’re like a house, Leave the front door and back door open, 
          Allow your thoughts to come and go. Just don’t serve them tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could focus on our body, our breathing, listening to sounds, 
          or looking at a visual object. This helps us to be present, and 
          it teaches us how not to get too entangled in our thoughts.
          We train in returning to our chosen focus when we realize our 
          minds have wandered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where to seat? An ideal position would be with a wall or the 
          corner of the room behind you, providing a sense of security 
          and stability.
          Your feet are parallel, flat on the floor, and your hands can 
          be in your lap, resting with the palms up—right hand on top of 
          the left, the tips of the thumbs just touching—or place your 
          hands on your legs, with the palms down on your knees or thighs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s better if your eyes are open, not looking around the room, but 
          gazing into the space in front of you, perhaps at an angle downward, 
          and of course you should blink whenever you need to. 
          You’re not particularly focusing on anything, you’re just looking 
          into space.
          Meditating with the eyes open is a statement that everything is fine 
          just as it is, that there is no need to get rid of anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guidance is not so great, however, when it becomes a “crutch”; after 
          some time you could grow dependent on the person’s voice, which means 
          you’re not actually doing the meditation for yourself—your mind 
          wanders and it is the voice, not you, that brings you back to the 
          focus. So it is best to then go “solo,” like taking the training 
          wheels off a bicycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cortisol levels are highest in the morning—we experience a spike in 
          the hormone to help our body move from the sleep state to the waking 
          state—so it’s good to bring the levels back to normal with meditation 
          before starting the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mind drifts away, and all you need to do is gently capture your 
          attention and bring it back, using your body as the anchor.

        <h2>Breath by James Nestor </h2>
        <p>
          Hindus considered breath and spirit the same thing, and described 
          elaborate practices that were meant to balance breathing and 
          preserve both physical and mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buddhists, who used breathing not only to lengthen their lives but 
          to reach higher planes of consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mouthbreathing causes the body to lose 40 percent more water. I felt 
          this all night, every night, waking up constantly parched and dry. 
          You’d think this moisture loss would decrease the need to urinate, 
          but, oddly, the opposite was true.
          The kidneys will release water, which triggers the need to urinate 
          and signals to our brains that we should consume more liquid.
          We get thirsty, and we need to pee more.
        </p>
        <p>
          mouthbreathing contributed to periodontal disease and bad breath, 
          and was the number one cause of cavities, even more damaging than 
          sugar consumption, bad diet, or poor hygiene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone really needed was a postage-stamp-size piece of tape at the 
          center of the lips.

          I never woke up needing to pee. I didn’t have to, because my 
          pituitary gland was likely releasing vasopressin. 

          I was finally sleeping soundly.

          Only way to retain a slow resting heart rate is with slow breaths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our ancient ancestors chewed for hours a day, every day. And because 
          they chewed so much, their mouths, teeth, throats, and faces grew to 
          be wide and strong and pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just meant holding the lips together, teeth lightly touching, with 
          your tongue on the roof of the mouth. Hold the head up perpendicular 
          to the body and don’t kink the neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deeper and more softly we breathe in, and the longer we exhale, 
          the more slowly the heart beats and the calmer we become.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we take short, hasty breaths, the molecules of air switch on the 
          sympathetic nerves. These work like 911 calls. The more messages the 
          system gets, the bigger the emergency. That negative energy you feel 
          when someone cuts you off in traffic or wrongs you at work is the 
          sympathetic system ramping up. 

          In these states, the body redirects blood flow from less-vital organs 
          like the stomach and bladder and sends it to the muscles and brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simpler and less intense methods of breathing slow, less, through the 
          nose with a big exhale, can also diffuse stress and restore balance.

          Once a day, they were to lie down, take a brief inhale, and then 
          exhale to a count of 6. As they progressed, they could inhale to a 
          count of 4 and exhale to 8, with the goal of reaching a half-minute 
          exhale after six months of practice. 

          Upon reaching this 30 count, Rama promised his students, they 
          “will not have any toxins and will be disease-free.” 

          In an instructional video, gently stroking his own arm, he said, 
          “Your body will look like smooth body, like silk, you see?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The perfect breath is this: Breathe in for about 5.5 seconds, then 
          exhale for 5.5 seconds. That’s 5.5 breaths a minute for a total of 
          about 5.5 liters of air.
