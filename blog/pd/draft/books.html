        <h2>Still Me by Christopher Reeve</h2>
        <p>
          This is the determined, passionate story of one man, a gifted actor 
          and star, and how he and his family came to grips with the kind of 
          devastating, unexplainable shock that fate can bring to any of us.

        <h2>Running on Empty by Guy Deacon</h2>
        <p>
          A powerful memoir about Deacon’s solo, 18,000-mile journey across 
          Africa in a VW camper van despite his stage three Parkinson's—an 
          inspiring story of courage, independence, and raising awareness.
