        <h2>Still Me by Christopher Reeve</h2>
        <p>
          This is the determined, passionate story of one man, a gifted actor 
          and star, and how he and his family came to grips with the kind of 
          devastating, unexplainable shock that fate can bring to any of us. 
        </p>
        <p>
          They would set a target level and throw numbers at me, shouting, 
          “You’ve got to beat that number.” It was a simple exercise, but it 
          got me going. Each day I tried to beat the previous day’s numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At first it was a wholly new experience for me to try to move one 
          muscle at a time. It took a while for my brain to make a connection 
          with the muscle I wanted to move. I’d have to think: My brain to my 
          right shoulder. Okay, I just want that trapezius muscle at the top 
          of my right shoulder to move. All right, let’s go. One, two, three, 
          go. I would will it to move. Gradually, the numbers began to improve. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn’t give up, because additional recovery can occur after six 
          months, a year, even eighteen months, two years. That motivated me 
          to keep exercising. Nerves can find new pathways, new ways to 
          stimulate the muscles.

          I was aware that if I allowed it to atrophy, I might never be able 
          to use it. 
          I decided I had to make another attempt to breathe on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was only able to draw in an average of 50 cc’s with each attempt. 
          But at least it was something. I had moved the dial.
          Dr asked me to take another ten breaths for a comparison with 
          yesterday’s numbers. I took the ten breaths, and my average for 
          each one was 450 cc’s. They couldn’t believe it. 
          I thought to myself: All right. Now we’re getting somewhere.
        </p>

          At the dinner table, when each of us in turn spoke a few words 
          about what we were thankful for, Will said, “Dad.”

          A psychologist at Kessler once said to me, 
          “Don’t turn your wife into your nurse or your mother.”

        <h2>A Monk's Guide to Happiness by Gelong Thubten</h2>
        <p>
          You’re like a house, Leave the front door and back door open, 
          Allow your thoughts to come and go. Just don’t serve them tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could focus on our body, our breathing, listening to sounds, 
          or looking at a visual object. This helps us to be present, and 
          it teaches us how not to get too entangled in our thoughts.
          We train in returning to our chosen focus when we realize our 
          minds have wandered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where to seat? An ideal position would be with a wall or the 
          corner of the room behind you, providing a sense of security 
          and stability.
          Your feet are parallel, flat on the floor, and your hands can 
          be in your lap, resting with the palms up—right hand on top of 
          the left, the tips of the thumbs just touching—or place your 
          hands on your legs, with the palms down on your knees or thighs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s better if your eyes are open, not looking around the room, but 
          gazing into the space in front of you, perhaps at an angle downward, 
          and of course you should blink whenever you need to. 
          You’re not particularly focusing on anything, you’re just looking 
          into space.
          Meditating with the eyes open is a statement that everything is fine 
          just as it is, that there is no need to get rid of anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guidance is not so great, however, when it becomes a “crutch”; after 
          some time you could grow dependent on the person’s voice, which means 
          you’re not actually doing the meditation for yourself—your mind 
          wanders and it is the voice, not you, that brings you back to the 
          focus. So it is best to then go “solo,” like taking the training 
          wheels off a bicycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cortisol levels are highest in the morning—we experience a spike in 
          the hormone to help our body move from the sleep state to the waking 
          state—so it’s good to bring the levels back to normal with meditation 
          before starting the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mind drifts away, and all you need to do is gently capture your 
          attention and bring it back, using your body as the anchor.

        <h2>Running on Empty by Guy Deacon</h2>
        <p>
          A powerful memoir about Deacon’s solo, 18,000-mile journey across 
          Africa in a VW camper van despite his stage three Parkinson's—an 
          inspiring story of courage, independence, and raising awareness.
