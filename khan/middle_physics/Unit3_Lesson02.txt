hello everyone let's talk about,potential energy potential energy is,energy that is stored in an object and,this energy is related to the potential,or the future possibility for an object,to have a different type of energy like,kinetic energy from motion that is,converted from that potential energy,there are many kinds of potential energy,but they all arise from an object's,relation to a position or an original,shape,so while in general there are many,different types of potential energy,there are several specific types that,are very common so let's talk about,these,gravitational potential energy is the,potential energy that an object with,mass has due to the force of gravity,from another object with mass like say,the earth,and in fact we often use the surface of,the earth to compare an object's,position with to see how much potential,energy it has in the earth's,gravitational field,gravity is an attractive force so,objects with mass want to move towards,the surface of the earth if we move them,further away or opposite the direction,of the gravitational force we increase,their gravitational potential energy and,the opposite is true if it gets closer,when an object is on the surface of,earth we typically say it has no,potential energy but you could use any,point to be this comparison where,potential energy is zero,consider a book on a bookshelf if the,book is on this shelf we can use this,shelf as the 0.4 potential energy moving,it to a higher shelf would mean it has,gravitational potential energy relative,to that lower shelf,or relative to the floor if we want to,use that as our comparison instead,next we have elastic potential energy,which is the potential energy some,objects have due to their shape being,changed these types of objects are,called elastic objects,elastic objects are made of materials,and designed so they have internal or,inside forces that try to return them to,their original shape,one very common example of this is a,spring when you stretch or compress a,spring you change its shape and the,shape of the spring causes internal,forces that try to return the spring to,its original shape,now electric potential energy which is,the potential energy a charged object,has due to the electric force from,another charged object,opposite electric charges are attracted,to one another and similar electric,charges are repelled so the potential,energy depends on what type of charges,there are and how far apart they are,potential energy increases when the,charges move opposite the direction of,the electric force for example when two,negative charges get closer together,similarly magnetic potential energy is,the potential energy a magnetic object,has due to the magnetic force from,another magnet,magnetic force causes similar poles to,repel one another and opposite poles to,attract and because magnets have north,and south poles the potential energy,depends not only on the position within,a field but also the magnet's,orientation,again you could increase the potential,energy by moving the magnets opposite,the direction of the magnetic force for,example by pulling apart a north pole,and a south pole,all of these types of energy are due to,different forces and are calculated,differently from different equations,which we won't cover here but they are,all potential energy and these are just,a few of the most common types of,potential energy but there are more,in summary potential energy is the,stored energy in an object due to its,position its properties and the forces,acting on it,potential energy is measured relative to,some comparison position or shape and,describes the potential for other forms,of energy commonly kinetic energy from,motion to exist,there are many forms of potential energy,including gravitational elastic magnetic,and electric thanks for watching and i,hope you learned a little bit of,something

## Key points:
Potential energy is energy that has the potential to become another form of energy. An object’s potential energy depends on its physical properties and position in a system.
Potential energy comes in many forms, such as:
Gravitational potential energy due to an object’s mass and position in a gravitational field
Magnetic potential energy due to a magnetic object’s position in a magnetic field
Electric potential energy due to the size of an electric charge and its position in an electric field
Elastic potential energy of a spring or rubber band that is stretched
Changing an object’s position can change its potential energy. This depends on the forces between objects.
For example, if two objects attract each other, moving them apart will increase their potential energies. If two objects repel each other, moving them apart will decrease their potential energies.

**Potential Energy**

Have you ever held a ball high in the air? It has **energy**, but it’s not moving yet. This is called **potential energy** — the energy stored and ready to do work later.

**Gravitational Potential Energy**
When you lift something up, like a ball or a book, you give it **gravitational potential energy**. The higher you lift it, the more energy it stores. This energy comes from Earth’s pull, called gravity. If you drop the ball, this stored energy turns into motion, called kinetic energy, and the ball falls fast!

**Electric Potential Energy**
If you have two bits that have **charge** (like + or -), they can push or pull each other. When they are close, they have electric potential energy. Think of a battery — it stores energy by keeping charges apart. When the charges move, this energy changes to light or sound.

**Magnetic Potential Energy**
Magnets can pull or push each other too. When two magnets with the same poles (like north to north) are close, they push hard. This takes energy to hold them close. This stored energy is **magnetic potential energy**. If you let go, the magnets push apart and the energy changes to motion.

**Elastic Potential Energy**
Think of a rubber band or a spring. When you pull or push them, they store energy. This is called **elastic potential energy**. When you let go, the stored energy makes them snap back or jump. That’s why a stretched rubber band can fly through the air!

**Why is Potential Energy Cool?**
Potential energy is like a power bank — it saves energy for later. When you lift a ball, pull a spring, or keep magnets close, you store energy. When you let go, that energy turns into motion, light, or sound.

It helps us in many ways. Trampolines store elastic energy to help you jump high. Batteries store electric energy to power toys. And gravity helps water flow down to turn turbines that make power for homes!

So, potential energy is all about saving power to use later. It’s hidden energy that can change into many things and make the world work!
