## Gravitational Force
when you hear the word gravity you,probably just think of things falling,like an apple from a tree,but did you know it's also the reason,why your lamp is staying on the floor,that's because gravity is so much more,than things falling down,gravitational forces are these invisible,forces that pull objects together,so gravitational force is actually,attracting the lamp to the floor,and these forces exist between all,objects with mass,so let's write these key points out,about gravitational forces which i'm,going to use gf to represent,we said they are attractive forces,and that they exist between,all objects with mass,objects with,mass,to explain this we first need to,remember a couple of things,mass is how much matter,objects have,and matter is the stuff an object is,made of,any object with mass generates a,gravitational pull so there is a,gravitational force of attraction,between every object,the amount of gravitational force,between two objects will depend on two,things,the masses of the two objects,and the distance between them,the mass of each object is proportional,to the gravitational force this means,that the more mass an object has,the stronger its gravitational force,and now we can understand why gravity,makes things fall the earth is massive,literally,it's almost 6 septillion,kilograms,that's a 6 with 24 zeros after it,so it generates a huge attractive force,for comparison my lamp is only one,kilogram which is why if i jump i fall,towards the earth and not towards my,lamp,but we said the mass of the object is,just one factor affecting the strength,of its gravitational force,the other is the distance between,objects,the more distance between the objects,the weaker the gravitational pull,between them,for small objects without much mass it,doesn't take much distance for their,gravitational forces between each other,to be so weak that we don't notice them,for something like the earth you have to,go really far away to not be affected by,its gravitational force of attraction,i mean look at the moon it's almost 240,000 miles away that's almost 400 000,kilometers away and it still feels,effects from earth's gravity,that's why it's orbiting us,but since the moon is also a pretty,massive object we do experience the,effects of its gravitational pull on the,earth,this is why we have tides,the moon's gravitational force will pull,on earth's water which results in us,having high and low tides,now you might be wondering if gravity,can affect the moon or cause tides how,can we even move around why aren't we,just face planted on the ground because,earth's gravity is pulling us towards it,it turns out that actually gravity is a,pretty weak force we only even notice,its effects when an object is massive,like planets or stars,and the gravitational force on you is,way weaker than most forces you exert,every day in fact every time you pick up,a glass of water you're overpowering the,entire mass of earth how cool is that

## Key points:
The force of gravity, or gravitational force, pulls objects with mass toward each other.
We often think about the force of gravity from Earth. This force is what keeps your body on the ground.
But any object with mass exerts a gravitational force on all other objects with mass. For example, there is a gravitational force between you and every object around you!
The gravitational force between two objects is larger when the masses of the objects are larger. That’s why you can feel the gravitational force between you and Earth, but the force between you and objects with smaller masses is too weak to feel.
The gravitational force between two objects also depends on the distance between their centers. The further objects are from one another, the weaker the force is.

**Gravitational Force**

Why do we stay on the ground? Why do balls drop when we let go? It’s all due to a force called **gravity**.

Gravity is a pull that pulls things down. The Earth is big and has a lot of mass. It pulls on us and all things around. That pull is gravity.

If you jump up, you come back down. Why? Because the Earth pulls you down. The ball you toss up also falls back down. That’s gravity at work.

All big things pull on small things. The Sun pulls on the Earth. The Earth pulls on the Moon. The Moon pulls on the sea to make tides.

The pull of gravity gets less as things move far. If you go high in the sky, the pull of the Earth is less. That’s why astronauts float in space.

But no matter where you go, gravity is there. It keeps us on the ground, keeps the Moon going around the Earth, and keeps the Earth going around the Sun.

So, next time you drop a toy, say thanks to gravity!
