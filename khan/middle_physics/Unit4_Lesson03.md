## Transmission and Refraction
when we're talking about waves,transmission is when a wave passes from,a material into another one for example,here we have the sun,93 million miles away on average and,imagine the different materials that the,light has to travel through from the sun,to say hit,one of these sand particles right over,here think about what it needs to be,transmitted through,well it's going to travel through 93,million miles of the vacuum of space and,that's one of the amazing things about,light waves is that they don't need a,medium they can travel through vacuum,through emptiness but then it's going to,travel through several miles of earth's,atmosphere so it's going to travel,through several miles of earth's,atmosphere it'll hit these the lenses of,these sunglasses it'll actually travel,through the lenses of the sunglass the,sunglass has some width or some depth to,it and then it'll go out onto the other,side and it will hit the sand right over,here,now one thing you might realize is the,amount of transmission and what gets,transmitted is dependent on the,wavelengths of the wave in this case the,wavelengths of light and also about the,material that they are going through so,for example these sunglasses right over,here many sunglasses try to keep out uv,light ultraviolet light which is a,higher frequency than visible light but,that's what causes sunburns and that can,also damage your eyes so those high,frequencies are not making it through,and we could also see that this sunglass,right over here it kind of has an,orangish color which means that things,that are closer to that end of the,spectrum closer to the red the oranges,and the yellows are getting through,which means that it's filtering out blue,light so the blue light isn't getting,transmitted through as much as say the,red orange and yellow light and that's,why we see this as red orange or yellow,and then of course the light will get to,that sand particle,now transmission as i mentioned it isn't,just about light waves we could talk,about one of our other favorite types of,waves for example sound waves if you are,in a room you have probably experienced,the fact that even if you were to close,the door and i do this a lot because i,record a lot of videos this is me in my,little closet recording a video this is,a top view or what i'm doing right now a,lot of times my kids are in other parts,of the house and they're making a lot of,noise and as we've talked about sound,waves are nothing but traveling pressure,waves through the air those air,particles are knocking one into another,but in order to make it to me they need,to get through that wall and the way,they do that is they get transmitted to,through that wall so those air particles,make the particles or make the atoms or,the molecules in the wall start,vibrating they bump into each other and,then the particles on the other side of,the wall will bump into the air in my,little closet and then we will have once,again the sound waves make it to me now,the overall magnitude of the sound the,volume of the sound will likely be,diminished and not all of the,frequencies of the sound will be,transmitted equally different,frequencies of sound waves are better at,traveling through certain materials just,as we talked about with light waves so,now when you look at the world around,you or you hear the world around you or,look at other types of ways just think,about how it's transmitting from one,material into anotherwhen light is going through a uniform,medium like the air or as we know light,can go through vacuum so nothing at all,we imagine it going in a straight line,but we see something really interesting,happening here when it hits this glass,prism i know it just looks like a gray,triangle to you but imagine it as a,triangular piece of glass and it's,hitting it at an angle what this,animation shows us is that the path of,the light actually gets bent,and not only does it get bent but the,different frequencies of the light get,bent by different amounts now if you,were to look at this with your eyes you,wouldn't be able to see the actual waves,like we're seeing in this diagram right,over here you would just see how your,brain or how your mind perceives the,various frequencies and that's why they,made the higher frequencies here more,like a violet or a purple color and,that's why they made the lower,frequencies here more of a red color,because that's how your brain or your,mind would perceive them but you can see,as as this light goes from let's say the,vacuum to this prism to this crystal or,this glass the high frequency light gets,bent more and the low frequency light,which still gets bent gets bent less and,then that essentially spreads out all,the wavelengths when we have white light,it has all of the visible wavelengths in,it but when it hits a prism like this if,you imagine a triangular piece of glass,or crystal and it hits it at an angle,well then the different wavelengths,spread out and if you were to put a,piece of paper here you would see a,rainbow and that's actually how rainbows,are formed a bunch of water particles in,the air refract light exactly like this,this process of when light goes from one,transparent medium to another or a,vacuum to some other medium that it can,travel through that's transparent if it,hits it at an angle it can get bent,which is what we call refraction this is,why when you look at a cup of water or,at a pool at an angle you're not seeing,directly through the pool the image gets,distortedso something very interesting is clearly,going on when we look at this pencil,dipped in this cup of water,we would expect if maybe there was no,water in this glass that we would just,see the pencil continue straight down in,a line that looks something like that,but that's clearly not what we are,seeing it looks like once we fill it,with water at least to our eye it looks,like the pencil gets bent or broken or,bent in some way,and this notion you might have heard,people call it refraction but it's,interesting to think about exactly why,this is happening and i'll give you a,hint this is all about the bending of,light and it's not just light that can,get bent as it goes from one medium into,another it can be any kind of wave,so let's think about what's going on,over here so first let's think about the,part of the pencil that is above the,water so this part right over here the,light is actually reflecting off of this,pencil and then it's bouncing straight,into our eye so just imagine a path from,this dot straight into your eye once,again from here it's going straight into,your eye when we go over here it still,doesn't look too distorted so you have,light that's going straight to your eye,it's going through the side of the glass,and then getting to your eye,but then once we get into the water,something's interesting you would expect,the point that what would have been here,would then go straight to your eye just,like everything up here but it turns out,that that light once it transitions from,going from the water to the glass and,then the air it bends so at the,interface between the media between,those different materials that the light,is traveling through instead of going,towards your eye it gets bent in this,case to our left and so that's why when,we look straight on here we don't see,anything in this region right over here,but the light that was going from the,pencil towards this part of the glass,which typically you would not see that,would have typically just gone straight,in that direction and not hit your eye,well now that is getting refracted it's,getting bent to the left so that now,that light hits your eye so that's why,you see what looks like a broken pencil,it's all about the light getting bent as,it exits the water and goes into the,glass,and then the air

## Key points:
Transmission happens when a wave travels through a medium or into a new medium.
Not all waves transmit through the same materials.
Transmission depends on the type of wave, type of material and even the frequency of the wave.
For example, if you knock on a door the vibration you create will transmit through the door and be heard as sound. However, light does not transmit through a door so you cannot be seen through it.
Usually, waves travel in a straight line until they interact with a boundary. Refraction happens when a wave’s path bends at a boundary as it transmits into a new medium.
The amount a wave refracts depends on the type of wave, the frequency of the wave, and the material it is moving into.
**Transmission and Refraction**

When light or sound goes through stuff, we call this **transmission**. It means the wave moves from one place to another by going **through** a thing, like air, glass, or water.

Think of light from the sun. It goes through a window. The light moves through the glass to your room. This is transmission. The light does not stop; it passes right through.

But sometimes, when light goes from one thing to another, it **bends**. This bending is called **refraction**. It happens because light moves at different speeds in different things.

For example, when light goes from air into water, it slows down. Because of this change in speed, the light bends. This is why a straw in a glass of water looks bent or broken at the top. The straw looks odd because the light is bent by refraction.

Refraction happens with all types of waves that can pass through stuff. It’s not just light — sound waves can bend too, but we notice it most with light.

Refraction is why lenses in glasses and cameras work. Lenses bend light to help us see better or to take clear photos.

**Transmission** is the path the wave takes when it goes through something.
**Refraction** is the change in the wave’s path when it bends as it goes through different stuff.

So, when light or sound moves through things, it travels by transmission. When it bends as it passes from one thing to another, that’s refraction!

These two things help us see, hear, and use many tools in our world. Without them, we would not have glasses, cameras, or even rainbows!
