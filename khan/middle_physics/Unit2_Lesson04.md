## Magnetic Forces
let's talk about magnets and magnetic,forces,magnets are these neat objects that are,able to attract metals like iron,magnets are used in all sorts of things,from holding paper on your refrigerator,to computers two compasses,so magnets can be used to stick things,together point us in the right direction,and even lift things,and they do this through magnetic forces,if you've handled two magnets you felt,magnetic forces even when the magnets,weren't touching each other that's,because magnetic forces are non-contact,forces which just means they can affect,other objects they aren't even touching,magnets will attract or,repel each other and this attraction or,repulsion is a magnetic force,but magnetic forces don't affect,everything the same way otherwise a,magnet would stick to you not just a,refrigerator,in this video we're going to talk about,the magnetic forces between two magnets,so why do magnets sometimes attract each,other and other times repel each other,well this has to do with the orientation,of the magnets,orientation is really just a fancy word,for how the magnets are positioned,compared to one another,you see it turns out that each magnet,has a north and a south pole,but what does this have to do with,attraction or repulsion,well as you may have heard opposites,attract so if you face the north pole of,one magnet to the south pole of another,magnet guess what,they will be attracted to each other,but if you turn one of those magnets,around so that you have two north poles,facing each other they will repel,and the same thing would happen if it,was two south poles facing each other,so the direction of the magnetic force,completely depends on the orientation of,the magnets,orientation though is just one thing,that affects magnetic forces the,strength of magnetic forces depends on a,couple of things,for one,distance,if you've ever held two magnets you may,have noticed that when you move them,closer they seem to almost jump together,or if you try to push two like poles,together they get harder and harder to,hold together the closer you get,this is because magnetic forces depend,on distance,the closer the two magnets are together,the stronger the force between them so,as the distance decreases the force,increases,but the farther away they are the weaker,the magnetic force is,so,distance increases force decreases,the other big factor that affects how,strong a magnetic force is well the,magnets themselves submagnets are really,weak like a lot of refrigerator magnets,others are so strong that even tiny ones,can be almost impossible to pull apart,some of these stronger magnets are even,used to make high-speed trains levitate,off the ground,and yes this rectangle is supposed to be,a train,while my drawing isn't amazing the fact,that magnetic forces can levitate a,train,is

## Key points:
A magnet is any object that can attract other materials with magnetic properties through a magnetic force.
Every magnet has a north pole and a south pole. Either pole will attract iron.
The direction of magnetic force between two magnets depends on how the poles are oriented.
Opposite poles attract
Like poles repel
The strength of a magnetic force depends on the strength of the magnets and the distance between magnetic objects.
The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are stronger.
Also, the magnetic force is stronger when objects are closer together.

**Magnetic Forces**

Have you seen a magnet stick to a fridge? That’s a **magnetic force**. It’s a pull or push made by a **magnet**.

A magnet has two ends: **north (N)** and **south (S)**. If you put two N ends close, they push away. Same for two S ends. But if you put N and S close, they pull in.

Why? Inside a magnet, tiny bits called **atoms** line up. When they line up right, they make a force. This force can pull or push things made of iron, steel, or nickel.

Not all things are pulled by a magnet. Only some metals feel the pull. Wood, glass, and paper don’t.

Think of Earth. It acts like a big magnet. It has a N and S pole. That’s why a compass points N. The needle is a tiny magnet pulled by Earth’s big force.

Magnets can also **stick** to each other. But if you flip one, they push away. This push and pull is how trains float, doors close, and toys move.

So, next time you play with a magnet, think of the tiny bits inside doing all the work!
