- If you hold a ball up
in the air and let it go,,you know it's going to fall, but why?,Nothing is touching it once you let it go.,How can there be a force on it?,Well, this is because
Earth's gravitational force,is pulling the ball and
gravity is a non-contact force.,Non-contact forces don't
have to touch an object,to exert a force on it.,Instead, these forces act over a region.,So if an object is in that region,,it will be affected by the force.,In this case, the ball is in
Earth's gravitational field,,and so it feels an attractive
force towards the Earth,and the ball falls to the ground.,Field forces include non-contact forces,,such as electric, magnetic,,and of course, gravitational forces.,So since these forces are non-contact,,they can exert a force on
objects they aren't touching,,but how do these objects know,if there's a force between them?,To explain these non-contact forces,,scientists eventually developed the idea,that these objects were
surrounded by something,called a field.,So what is a field?,A field extends through
space from an object,with certain physical properties.,What are those?,Well, for gravitational forces,,these affect objects with mass.,So any object with mass
has a gravitational field,surrounding it that points
towards the object's center.,The further you move away from the object,,the less dense the field and
weaker the field becomes.,Electric forces effect charged objects.,So an electric field surrounds
any object with a net charge,,and the direction of this field
will depend on the charge.,Magnetic fields will affect magnets,and any other material
with magnetic properties.,Each spot on a field has two
things associated with it:,magnitude and direction.,And these help us predict,what forces objects will experience,when they're in the field.,So let's look at an example
to help understand this.,Say we have a planet.,Now, the planet has a lot of mass,so we know it's going to be surrounded,by a gravitational field,that points towards the
center of the planet.,I can draw these little field lines,that show the direction of
the field and its strength.,As we move away from the planet,,the field will start to weaken,,and I'm going to represent
that by a less dense field,with these arrows.,Now, let's say there's an asteroid,moving near the planet in this direction.,I know that the asteroid,
as it's shown here,,is in the outskirts of this
planet's gravitational field.,So it is going to feel some
gravitational attraction,towards the planet,,which we can draw with this vector, Fg,,which is force of gravity.,Now, because it's attracted to the planet,,the astroid will continue
to move towards the planet.,And the closer the asteroid
gets to the planet,,the stronger the field,and the stronger the force
of attraction it will feel.,And so in this way,
scientists can use fields,to help predict behavior of objects,experiencing non-contact forces.,And all of this may sound kind of odd,,but you probably already
think about forces this way.,For example, if we go back to the ball,that you know is going to fall,,you knew this because the
force of gravity from Earth,was going to pull the
ball towards the Earth.,But now you also know that that's because,Earth's gravity is a field force.,And so the ball is in the
field of gravity for Earth,and experiences an attractive
gravitational force.,So while fields may sound mysterious,,they really just mean that a
force is felt over a distance.,Gravitational, electric,
and magnetic forces,are all field forces,,which means they act over distance,and can affect a lot of objects.

## Key points:
A field represents empty space around an object where a non-contact force, like gravity or an electric force, could exist.
The idea of fields was created to help explain how objects can exert forces on each other, even when they’re not touching each other.
Fields exist around objects with certain properties.
Gravitational fields exist around objects with mass.
Electric fields exist around objects with charge.
Magnetic fields exist around magnetic objects.
Each location in a field has a magnitude and direction. We can represent this by drawing field lines at different points around an object. These field lines can then be used to help explain the forces that an object would experience in that location.

**Fields: Gravitational, Electric, and Magnetic**

A **field** is a space where a force can act. You can’t see it, but it’s there. Think of it like air—you can’t see air, but you feel it.

**Gravitational Field:**
Earth has mass, so it makes a pull. This pull is called gravity. The space around Earth where this pull acts is the **gravitational field**. Drop a ball, and it falls. Why? It’s in Earth’s field. Big things, like the Sun, have big fields. Small things have small fields.

**Electric Field:**
Have you felt a shock from a door? That’s due to an **electric field**. If you rub a balloon, it gets charged. The space around it now has an electric field. Things in that space feel a pull or push. **+** pulls **-**, but **+** pushes **+**.

**Magnetic Field:**
A magnet makes a space where it can pull or push other magnets. This space is the **magnetic field**. Put a magnet near a fridge. The field pulls it close. Put two N ends close—they push away. This field is how compasses work too.

Fields are like **invisible webs** that pull or push. You can’t see them, but you feel them!
