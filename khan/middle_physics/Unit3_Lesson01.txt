hello everyone let's talk about kinetic,energy now kinetic might be an,unfamiliar word but it just comes from a,greek word that means of motion so,kinetic energy is energy from motion,any massive object that is in motion,then has kinetic energy but how much,first let's consider some comparisons,this nice rat family papa mama brother,and sister are sitting down to dinner at,a long table passing blocks of cheese,back and forth paparat asks for the,cheddar cheese and there are two,identical blocks brother rat pushes one,and sister wrap pushes the other so that,the second cheese is traveling twice as,fast as the first cheese which piece of,cheddar cheese do you think has more,kinetic energy,yes it's the one going faster,now paparat doesn't need both pieces of,cheddar so he eats one and sends one,back along with a small piece of swiss,that weighs half as much as the piece of,cheddar papa rat has better manners than,his children so he sends them both back,at the same speed,which piece of cheese would you think,has more kinetic energy now,yes the heavier or more massive object,in this case the cheddar will have more,kinetic energy,let's make it a little more complicated,brother and sister rat are full so they,send the cheeses back for mama rat,brother rat pushes the larger piece of,cheddar and sister wrap pushes the,smaller piece of swiss so that the swiss,is going twice as fast as the cheddar,now which cheese has more kinetic energy,in fact it turns out that it's the swiss,in this scenario kinetic energy depends,on both mass and speed but the,dependence on speed is stronger,this estimation of kinetic energy can be,quantified in an equation that lets us,calculate kinetic energy exactly we said,kinetic energy depends on the mass and,the speed which we'll write as v for,velocity so we can start with ke equals,m times v,but we said that it depends more on the,speed so the velocity here is actually,squared,this means that if an object's mass,doubles its kinetic energy also doubles,but if its speed doubles the kinetic,energy actually quadruples,and there's also a constant factor of,one-half at the beginning of the,equation but we won't go into the,details of the math of deriving this,today so this is the equation for,kinetic energy one-half mv squared let's,apply this equation to our cheesy,example say the swiss has a mass of .05,kilograms which makes the cheddar's mass,0.1 kilograms,when both cheeses have the same speed,say 2 meters per second the chatter's,kinetic energy is one-half times 0.1,kilograms times 2 meters per second,squared which is 0.2 joules the swiss's,kinetic energy is one-half times .05,kilograms times two meters per second,squared which is 0.1 joules or half the,kinetic energy of the cheddar so we can,see that at the same speed the cheddar,has more kinetic energy because it has,more mass,but when the swiss has a speed of 4,meters per second and the chatter still,has a speed of two meters per second the,swiss's kinetic energy is now one half,times point zero five kilograms times,four meters per second squared which is,point four joules so now the kinetic,energy of the swiss is twice the kinetic,energy of the cheddar so we can see that,even though the cheddar has more mass,the swiss has more kinetic energy,because it's going faster,in summary kinetic energy is the motion,energy of an object the equation for,kinetic energy is one-half mv squared so,as mass increases kinetic energy,increases like the more massive cheddar,versus the swiss,and as velocity increases kinetic energy,increases even more like the speedy,swiss versus the slower cheddar,thanks for watching and i hope you,learned a little bit of something

## Key points:
Kinetic energy is the energy that any object with mass has simply because it is moving. If an object is not moving, it has no kinetic energy.
An object’s kinetic energy is directly related to its mass. Imagine two objects moving at the same speed. If one object has twice the mass of the other, it will also have twice the kinetic energy.
An object’s kinetic energy is also related to the squared value of its speed. Imagine two objects with the same mass. If one is moving at twice the speed of the other, the faster object will have four times the kinetic energy.

**Kinetic Energy**

When things move, they have **energy**. This energy of motion is called **kinetic energy**.

If you run, jump, or throw a ball, you use kinetic energy. The faster you go, the more energy you have. A car that moves fast has more kinetic energy than a slow one.

Kinetic energy depends on two things: how much stuff is in the thing (**mass**) and how fast it moves (**speed**). Big things with lots of mass have more kinetic energy if they move fast.

For example, a heavy truck going slow may have the same kinetic energy as a small bike going fast.

If a thing stops, it loses kinetic energy. The energy changes to other forms, like heat or sound. When a ball hits the ground, it makes sound because its kinetic energy changes.

Kinetic energy is in every move you make and in all things that move. When you skate, kick a ball, or swim, kinetic energy helps you do it!

So, kinetic energy is the power of movement. The more speed and mass, the more kinetic energy you have!
