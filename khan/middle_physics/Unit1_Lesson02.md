## Forces and acceleration
so i have three different asteroids over,here and they have different masses and,we'll talk a lot more about what mass,means but one way to think about it is,how much stuff there is there there's,other ways to think about it and so,let's say that this first asteroid is,twice the mass of either of these two,smaller ones and these two smaller ones,have the same mass,now we've attached the back of a rocket,to each of these asteroids in fact this,one over here has two rockets and we're,going to assume that all of the rockets,are equivalent and we ignite them all,and so they all exert the same force,each on the asteroid so for example we,have a net force acting leftward on this,large asteroid we have the same net,force acting on this smaller asteroid,also going to the left and on this other,smaller asteroid we have two times that,net force acting to the left so what i,want you to do is pause this video and,think about which of these asteroids is,going to be accelerated the most and,which of these asteroids is going to be,accelerated the least,alright so you might have an intuition,that the larger the force the more,acceleration you might see so let me,write it like this so you might get a,sense that if you increase your force,that that's also going to increase your,acceleration,and it does turn out that that is indeed,the case,now the other notion that you might have,is that the more of the stuff that there,is the more mass that you have the,harder it is to accelerate it so if your,mass is larger then your acceleration is,lower and it turns out that these things,are all proportional,so for example if we just compare these,two masses right over here they have the,same net force acting on it and i keep,saying net force that means you just net,out all of the forces acting in a,certain dimension for example if i had,another identical rocket acting in the,opposite direction they would net out,and this asteroid right over here,wouldn't be accelerated at all,but going back to our example here we,have the same net force acting on each,of these asteroids but the first,asteroid has twice the mass of the,second asteroid so how do you think the,accelerations will relate,well as you might imagine the,acceleration on the larger asteroid is,going to be half the acceleration on,this asteroid or another way to think,about it this asteroid is going to have,twice the acceleration as this first,asteroid and that's because it has half,the mass,and one way you can relate force mass,and acceleration and this is one of the,most important equations in all of,physics is that force,is going to be equal to,mass,times acceleration or i could say the,magnitude of the force is equal to the,mass times the magnitude of the,acceleration,so notice in this example right over,here our forces are the same but the,masses are different if i have half the,mass as i have over here i'm going to,have twice the acceleration and that,might make intuitive sense if you've,ever tried to apply the same force to,something that has a small mass versus,something that has a large mass,now if we compare these two asteroids,they have the same mass here,but the force here the net force acting,in that left direction is double so if,you double the force don't change the,mass well then you're going to have,twice the acceleration,so this is going to have twice the,acceleration of this one and this one's,going to have twice the acceleration of,that one but the important thing to,realize is how force mass and,acceleration are connectedlet's say that we are in deep space and,there is this asteroid here that,compared to us is stationary or relative,to us is stationary,and what we want to do is we want to,start to move it,so what we do is we attach,a,rocket to one side,and then we ignite that rocket and it,starts to send all the superheated,gas all of these particles to the right,well what do you think that's going to,do to the asteroid well it's going to,push on the asteroid in,that direction,or you could say it's going to exert a,force on that asteroid and we could show,that force like this where the strength,of that force or the magnitude of the,force is the length of this line and,then the direction i will specify or,show with that arrow,so fair enough i will be pushing towards,the left,and when i push to the left it doesn't,just start to move the asteroid to the,left it actually will accelerate the,asteroid to the left so the longer that,this rocket is running it's going to,make the asteroid move to the left,faster and faster and faster,but let's think about another example,let's say that you and is one of your,friends you had a little bit of,miscommunication and they went and put,an identical rocket on this side of the,asteroid,and y'all ignited it at the exact same,time,so this one is going to push in the,other direction what do you think is,going to happen if these happen at the,exact same time,even though there's now twice as much,force being exerted on this asteroid,it's going in opposite directions so,they zero out and so there's zero net,force and so this asteroid won't be,accelerated at all,now let's say that a third friend wanted,to correct this situation and this isn't,necessarily the most efficient way to do,it but what they do is they put another,identical rocket,right over here and let's say,ignite that,now what will happen,well now you had the original two forces,that net out to each other but now you,have this also this new force which i,will make in purple because it's a,purple rocket and so that new force you,could draw,like this,to show all right that will now be the,net force because you have the,equivalent of two rockets going in the,left direction and one rocket going in,the right direction or another way we,could draw that is we have two rockets,going in the left direction so that,would have a force that looks like this,and then we have one going in the right,direction and so if you were to net it,out this is equivalent to just having,one rocket that we originally saw that's,equivalent to just going back to what we,originally saw so the important takeaway,from this video is that it's not just,about the force that's being applied if,you want to think about how something,might be accelerated and in what,direction you think about the net force,because some of the forces could,counteract each other

## Key points:
A force is a push or pull on an object.
A net force is the sum of all of the forces acting on an object.
When there is a net force on an object, the object will change speed in the direction of the net force. The object’s acceleration tells us how much it speeds up or slows down.
The acceleration of an object depends on the size of the net force pushing or pulling it and the mass of the object.
A larger net force creates a larger acceleration.
A larger mass needs a larger net force to have the same acceleration as a smaller mass.

**Force, Net Force, Mass, and Acceleration**

Think of a car. You push it. It moves. That push is a force. A force is a pull or push. It can make things start, stop, speed up, or slow down. If you kick a ball, that kick is a force. If you pull a toy, that pull is a force.

Now, let’s talk about mass. Mass is how much stuff is in a thing. A big box has more mass than a toy car. A rock has more mass than a leaf. The more mass, the harder it is to move. If you try to push a big rock, it takes a lot of force. If you push a toy car, it takes less force.

What is net force? Think of a rope. You pull it to the left. Your friend pulls it to the right. If you pull harder, the rope moves to your side. The net force is the sum of all forces. If both of you pull with the same force, the net force is zero, and the rope stays still. If one pulls harder, the net force is in that direction.

Now, let’s talk about acceleration. Acceleration is how fast something speeds up or slows down. If you push a toy car gently, it moves slow. If you push it hard, it moves fast. That change in speed is acceleration.

So, how do force, mass, and acceleration work together? Here’s a rule:

**Force = mass × acceleration**

This rule means that if you want to make something speed up, you need to push it with force. But how much force? It depends on how heavy it is (mass) and how fast you want it to go (acceleration).

For example:

* If a car is heavy, you need more force to make it move fast.
* If a toy is light, you need less force to make it move.

Think of a truck and a bike. The truck has more mass. The bike has less mass. If you push both with the same force, the bike will move faster because it has less mass. The truck will move slow because it has more mass.

Now, let’s say you push both the truck and the bike with more force. Both will go faster. That’s acceleration.

But what if you only push a little? Both will move slow. Less force means less acceleration.

So, to sum up:

* Force is a push or pull.
* Mass is how heavy something is.
* Net force is all the forces added up.
* Acceleration is how fast something speeds up.

They all work together. Push hard to move things fast. Push soft to move slow. Heavy things need more push. Light things need less. That’s how force, mass, and acceleration play in the world!
