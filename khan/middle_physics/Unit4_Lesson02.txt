let's talk about waves,so let's imagine that you were to take a,string and attach it at one end to a,wall,and then on the other end you were to,wiggle it up and down,well then you would have made a wave you,would see a pattern that looks like this,now what could be a good definition for,a wave well we could call it a traveling,disturbance well what does that mean,well we're disturbing the rope if we,didn't move it if we just held it,straight it might look something like,that or it might just hang down a little,bit but clearly we are now moving it up,and down and those movements are,disturbing that rope and that,disturbance can move along that rope now,we see waves not just in ropes that are,moving up and down you have probably,seen water waves if you were to take a,tank of water like this and if you were,to start pressing on one end of the,water here you would see these waveforms,that start,we can also see that with sound and,sound waves you might not realize it but,the sound of my voice right now is,actually just a traveling compression or,disturbance in the air that is getting,to your ear and then little hairs in,your ears can sense those changes in,pressure from the air and your mind,perceives that as sound and once again,this is a traveling disturbance you have,particles that have high pressure and,then they knock into the particles next,to them that then knock into the,particles next to them so if you were to,be able to observe this in slow motion,you would see these high pressure parts,right over here could be traveling say,to the right and even though this might,be a pressure wave that's traveling,through the air we can represent it in a,way that looks a lot like our first rope,that we were moving up and down areas,where things are high in the sound,example that's high pressure and you,have areas where things are low in the,sound example that is low pressure now,when we talk about waves they're common,properties for example we might want to,know how much are we getting disturbed,from what we would call the equilibrium,you could view that as maybe the middle,state right over there,well if we're getting disturbed that,much we could call that the amplitude,that's how much we are going,above or below that equilibrium this,would be the amplitude as well,we could think about how far is it from,the same points on the wave so if we go,from one peak to another peak,well we could call that the wavelength,and you could just do it from any one,point on the wave that's just like it on,the wave again so that would be the same,wavelength as our original wavelength,right over there you might hear the term,frequency of a wave and one way to think,about that is if you were to just,observe our original rope and if you,were to say how many times does it go,all the way up all the way down and then,back up so it completes a full cycle how,many times can it do that in a second if,it does that five times in a second then,someone might say it has a frequency of,five cycles per second,now everything that we have just talked,about these are called mechanical waves,it's a special category probably the,ones that you will see most often now,mechanical waves need a medium to travel,through in the rope example the medium,was the rope in the water example it's,the water in the sound example the,medium is the air,now there are things that can be,described as waves that don't need a,medium,in particular and this is kind of,mind-boggling is that light can be,considered a wave if we think about the,different frequencies of light our brain,perceives that as different colors and,if we think about the amplitude of light,our brain perceives that as the,intensity of light how bright it is and,even more mind-blowing visible light are,just certain frequencies of what we,would call electromagnetic waves there's,actually higher frequencies of,electromagnetic waves that have all,sorts of applications you might have,heard of ultraviolet light or x-rays or,gamma rays,similarly their lower wavelengths of,light you might have heard things like,infrared or radio waves these are all,just different frequencies of what's,known as,electromagnetic waves

## Key points:
Some waves can only travel through a material, or medium, such as air or water. These are called mechanical waves.
Sound waves, water waves, and seismic waves are all types of mechanical waves.
Other waves, called electromagnetic waves can travel through a medium or through a vacuum where there is no matter, such as outer space.
Light is a form of electromagnetic wave.
The amplitude and frequency of both mechanical and electromagnetic waves affect how we experience them.
A light wave’s amplitude determines how intense, or bright, it is. Its frequency determines the light wave’s color.
A ifferent. They do **not** need stuff to move through. They can move through space, even where there is no air or water.

Light from the Sun is an electromagnetic wave. So is the heat from a fire or the signals from a radio. These waves travel very fast — much faster than mechanical waves.

Electromagnetic waves come in many types:

* **Radio waves** — used for TV and phones
* **Microwaves** — used to heat food
* **Infrared waves** — heat we can feel
* **Visible light** — what our eyes see
* **Ultraviolet light** — from the Sun, can burn skin
* **X-rays** — used to see bones
* **Gamma rays** — from space, very strong energy

All these waves move as electric and magnetic fields that change and move together. That is why they are called electromagnetic waves.

**How Waves Carry Energy**
Both mechanical and electromagnetic waves carry energy. Mechanical waves push and pull the stuff they move through, like air or water. Electromagnetic waves carry energy in their electric and magnetic parts.

Mechanical waves move slower and need stuff to travel. Electromagnetic waves move fast and can move through empty space.

**Why It Matters**
Understanding waves helps us with many things. Sound waves help us talk and hear. Water waves help fish and boats. Electromagnetic waves let us see, heat food, and use phones and radios.

So, waves are all around us, moving energy in two main ways: with stuff (mechanical waves) or without stuff (electromagnetic waves). Both are super cool!
sound wave’s amplitude determines how loud it is. Its frequency determines the sound wave’s pitch.
**Mechanical Waves and Electromagnetic Waves**

Waves are ways that energy moves. There are two big types of waves: **mechanical waves** and **electromagnetic waves**. Both carry energy, but they work in different ways.

**Mechanical Waves**
Mechanical waves need stuff to move. This means they need a **medium** like air, water, or a solid to travel through. When you throw a rock in a pond, the ripples that spread out are mechanical waves in water. When you hear sound, that is a mechanical wave moving through the air.

There are two main types of mechanical waves:

* **Transverse waves:** The wave moves up and down, but the stuff it moves through goes side to side. Think of waves on a rope or water waves.
* **Longitudinal waves:** The wave and the stuff it moves through go the same way, back and forth. Sound waves in the air are this type.

Mechanical waves can’t move without something to move through. No air? No sound! No water? No ripples!

**Electromagnetic Waves**
Electromagnetic waves are very d
