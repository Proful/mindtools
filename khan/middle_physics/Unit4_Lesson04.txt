i'm showing you this beautiful picture,of snow-capped mountains overlooking,this alpine lake because there's a lot,of light moving around now we're going,to talk about the different ways that,light can interact with different media,but what i'm talking about can generally,be true of waves but focusing on light,for a second we've already talked about,how if we go from one medium to another,if we're transmitting from one medium to,another that the light can go through a,medium and as it goes through that,boundary from one medium to another its,direction can change and we talk about,that in another video and we call that,refraction we have refraction when we,enter the material and then we have more,refraction when we get out,now there's other things that light can,also do,and that's the focus of this video,reflection and absorption now you,probably have a sense of what happens,with reflection we can see a reflection,of the mountains in the lake right over,here and the reason why we can see the,reflection of the mountains in the lake,here is because light that is coming,from this mountain,is hitting the lake and then it is,bouncing off of it and then coming to an,observer's eyeball right over here and,so they see the light that's coming from,here they see it as coming from over,here because it is bounced off and so,reflection is exactly that light is,coming in it hits that other material,and then if it bounces off that's,reflection now the other thing that,light can do is get absorbed absorbed is,when the material doesn't reflect any,and doesn't transmit any through it if,it's completely absorbing and so that,would be a situation like this now the,reality in the real world is we have,often times a little bit of all of the,above happening,for example,when we look at this white snow up here,this is reflecting pretty well so,there's light that's coming from the sun,or maybe it's being reflected off the,clouds or maybe it's getting through the,clouds and when it hits that snow it,gets reflected now the reason why we,don't see a reflection the way that we,see in this lake right over here is the,snow reflects it in all different,directions but the fact that it's that,bright color in fact you might need,sunglasses to look at the snow just as,much as you need to look at the sky is,that it's reflecting most of the light,but if you go down here where we see the,trees the same light from the sky is,hitting it but not as much light is,coming back to our eye and that's,because this part of the mountain it,might be trees it might be rock it might,be dirt is absorbing more of the light,but it's still reflecting some we can,still see it a little bit so this might,be where it's most of it is getting,absorbed but a little bit of the light,gets reflected which we can see right,over there and if we think about the,water right over here some of the light,is probably making it through and,probably refracting as it does so some,of it is getting absorbed as it makes,its way through the water if this was a,really deep lake when you get to the,bottom it could be very very dark and,then as we talked about it looks like a,good bit is reflecting when we look at,the image that we see in the lake it,looks almost as bright as the real thing,so as i said this is happening all,around you in fact when people make,fancy computer graphics they actually,try to do exactly what the light would,do in the real world to make an image,for your eyes that look like the real,world and they're thinking exactly about,this how much gets through the substance,how much gets reflected and how much,gets absorbed and as i mentioned it's,not just light waves that do this waves,in general can do all of the above

## Key points:
Reflection happens when a wave bounces off of a boundary between two materials.
Reflection depends on the type of wave, the wave’s frequency, and the material.
Absorption happens when a wave loses energy as it transmits into a material. This can happen in a medium or at a boundary between two materials.
When a wave is absorbed by a material, its energy turns into another form of energy, such as thermal or electrical energy.
The amount a wave is absorbed depends on the type of wave, the wave’s frequency, and the material.
*also works with sound. When you shout in a big hall, your voice bounces off the walls and you hear an echo. That bounce back is sound reflection.

**How They Work Together**
Some things absorb waves, some reflect waves, and some do both. For example, a shiny metal reflects light well, but a black cloth absorbs it.

Understanding absorption and reflection helps us make good homes, cars, and clothes. It helps us use mirrors, paints, and even speakers!

So, when waves hit stuff, they either get soaked in (absorption) or bounce back (reflection). Both help us see, hear, and feel the world around us!
*Absorption and Reflection**

When light or sound hits a thing, it can do two main things: it can be **absorbed** or it can be **reflected**.

**Absorption**
Absorption is when a wave, like light or sound, hits something and gets taken in. The wave’s energy moves into the thing and does not bounce back.

For example, when the sun shines on dark clothes, the clothes get warm. This is because dark things absorb more light and change that light into heat. That’s why you feel hot in dark shirts on a sunny day.

Sound can be absorbed too. When you are in a room with soft things like curtains or rugs, the sound is absorbed and the room feels quiet. Soft stuff stops sound from bouncing around.

**Reflection**
Reflection is when the wave hits a thing and bounces back. The wave does not go in; it bounces off like a ball hitting a wall.

You see reflection with light all the time. When you look in a mirror, light bounces off the mirror and back to your eyes. That’s why you can see your face.
