## Action and Reaction Forces
you've probably heard the phrase that,for every force there's an equal and,opposite reaction force and this is also,known as newton's third law of motion,but it's also one of the most,misunderstood laws of physics so that's,why we're going to dig into it a little,bit in this video,so i have two examples here where,newton's third law or this notion of an,action and a reaction force is happening,so over here you have this plane flying,and the plane is able to move forward,by pushing air particles through these,jet engines so these air particles are,pushed outward at a very very high,velocity out the back of the engines,if you were to enlarge one of those air,particles let's say this is this purple,dot right over here there is a force,that is being exerted on it by the jet,engine and that force is going in that,direction,so what is the equal and opposite,reaction force,well the equal and opposite reaction,force is not also occurring on that,molecule it's what the molecule is doing,to the plane,the equal and opposite reaction force is,that the molecule is going to be pushing,on the jet engine with an equal but an,opposite force so it's going to go in,the opposite direction and that's how,the jet is able to accelerate forward by,pushing on these particles and,accelerating them backward by exerting a,force on them the equal and opposite,force is the force that the particles,those molecules of air are exerting on,the jet and moving it forward,the same thing here is going on with,this rocket,you have some rocket fuel in there it,gets ignited it explodes and as it,explodes there's a force that exerts on,those little molecules and that force,is going in this direction,but as it does that there's an equal and,opposite force that the molecules are,exerting on the rocket the rocket is,having a force acted on it once again,equal and opposite,so it's important to realize that the,reaction force is not on the same object,it's on the other object if one object,is putting an action force on another,then the second object is putting a,reaction force on the first the forces,do not cancel out,it's also important to realize that both,forces are generated in pairs and happen,at the exact same time there's no delay,we can look at other examples of this,this is a scenario that i would never,want to be caught in being drifting,through space now this astronaut here,has some type of a rocket pack that,might help it move around but let's say,your rocket pack,ran out of fuel and you're just drifting,through space how can you get back to,your spaceship,well if you have a wrench or something,on you that you can throw,if you can,take that wrench,and if you can push that wrench in that,direction and let's say your spaceship,is over here to the left,well the equal and opposite force is the,force that the wrench is going to exert,on you the astronaut and then it will,push you in that direction and,accelerate you in that direction so,that's a useful thing if you ever get,caught drifting through space but you,can do an experiment right now,press on the table in front of you when,you press on that table you're clearly,putting a force onto that table if your,table is soft you will see it get,compressed but notice your finger itself,is also getting compressed and the whole,reason why you can even feel that is,because your finger is getting,compressed and that is the equal and,opposite force that the table is putting,on your finger and this can happen at,very very large distances as well,the whole reason why the moon is in,orbit around the earth is because,there's a gravitational force,of earth's mass acting on the moon but,there's an equal and opposite,force of the moon,acting,on earth,and it's actually not that the moon is,rotating around the earth it's actually,they're both rotating around the center,of mass of their combination that just,happens to be so much closer to earth,it's actually within earth's volume that,it looks like the moon is rotating,around the earth and this isn't just,celestial bodies i weigh 165 pounds that,is the force that earth is acting on me,due to gravity but it turns out that,there's an equal and opposite force of,165 pounds that i am pulling on earth,with,so i will leave you there look around,the world this is happening everywhere,for every force there's an equal and,opposite reaction force but they don't,cancel out because they're acting on,different bodies

## Key points:
For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.
Let’s think about an example: when you push on a box, the box pushes back on you. Your push on the box is the action force. The force from the box on you is the reaction force. The two forces have the same strength, but they act in opposite directions.
Every force has a reaction force. A force and its reaction are generated together and happen at the same time.

**Action and Reaction Forces**

When you push on a wall, the wall pushes back. This is an action and a reaction.

An action is when you do something, like push or pull. A reaction is what happens back to you. If you push a door, the door pushes back on you. If you kick a ball, the ball pushes back on your foot.

This is called Newton’s Third Law. It says:
**For every push, there is a push back. For every pull, there is a pull back.**

Let’s think of a rocket. The rocket pushes gas down. The gas pushes the rocket up. That push up is the reaction. The push down is the action.

If you jump, you push the ground down. The ground pushes you up. That’s why you go up when you jump.

Even when you sit, you push down on the chair. The chair pushes up on you. That’s why you do not fall.

So, every action has a reaction. Push on water, water pushes back. Push on the ground, ground pushes back. This is how forces work in pairs!
