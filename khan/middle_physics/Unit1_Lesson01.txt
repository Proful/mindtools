hi everyone Sal Khan here and welcome to,Middle School physics I have Iman Howard,who manages all of our stem content Iman,why should folks be excited about Middle,School physics,so Middle School physics is like the,only science out there that explains how,things happen and so basically,everything's made of matter me you um,the chair that I'm sitting on and this,course is going to explore how we exist,in the natural world so for example we,talk a little bit about movement and,forces and we learned that everything,everything that we have a collision with,has this equal but opposite Force that's,applied when the Collision happens so,that's why when you give those high,fives and then your hand starts stinging,it's because the same Force you gave,your buddy is the same Force they gave,you back and then we also talk about,force in a way where it doesn't touch,you so like I'm thinking like Star Wars,there's like this Force energy like,gravitational uh there's magnetic energy,there's electric energy and then finally,we get into waves and we talk a little,bit about how waves you know exist,whether it's sound waves or even the,waves in the ocean what do you think's,exciting,oh well that's a dangerous question to,ask me I wanted to be a physicist and I,still aspire to be it because you know,we kind of wake up in this Cosmos and,we're just trying to understand what,where we fit in and physics asks the,most fundamental questions about how the,universe works and so when I first,learned about Newton's laws and Fields,and all the things that you just touched,on it started to give me goosebumps,because I'm like wow we can finally,understand how the universe fits,together and then use that to make,predictions and then think about things,that we don't understand and there is so,much that we don't understand so I think,this is the beginning of a very very,exciting journey in physics,I agree so- [Illustrator] Did you
know that communication,is actually one of the most
important things in science?,As we discover cool things,,we need to be able to
share them with others.,And when we're talking
about data and measurements,with other scientists,,we need to make sure
we're on the same page.,So how do we do that?,Well, one of the ways is to use units.,We use units whenever we talk
about things like position,,where an object is located,
how long it is, it's mass,,how much matter it's made
up of or it's motion.,How is that object moving?,You probably hear units every day.,For example, you've grown,,let's say an inch and a
half in the past year,,or that tree over there is 25 feet tall.,And maybe you went swimming
in a 25 meter pool.,And we're just gonna pretend
that the pool is a rectangle,because as you can tell from my tree,,my artistic skills are not that great.,Anyway, this brings up
a super important point,about why we use units.,I just used three examples
of length measurements,with three different units,
inches, feet, and meters.,Imagine if I didn't attach a unit,to any of these measurements,,you grew one and a half, what? Meters?,Whoa, one and a half hands.,Well, whose hands?,Your hands or my hands?,Woof, well, pretend those are hands.,Units let us know how much
of a quantity there is.,So a meter is always
used to measure length,and we know exactly how long a meter is.,That way when we say
something is two meters long,,no one has to guess at how big that is.,Any measurement or data point
always needs to have a unit,or else it's just a meaningless number.,To avoid any confusion,,in science we use what
are called SI units.,SI units are the International System.,Could there be any more
letters in this word system,used by scientists all over the world.,We'll use meters to
describe position or length,,kilograms for mass,,and if we're talking about
the motion of something,,meters per second.,And while this is the agreed
upon scientific unit system,,you should be aware that
other systems do exist,,which means things can very
easily get very confusing,if you forget your units.,And you might be thinking,,&amp;quot;Oh, come on, who mixes up units?',Well, it happens more
often than you think,,even rocket scientists have done it.,I mean, a Mars Orbiter actually crashed,due to a mix up in units.,Now seriously, that actually happened,,look it up and remember to use your units.when we make new discoveries we need to,be able to share them with others and,the first thing we have to do is make,sure everyone is on the same page,we do this by using units and frames of,reference which are also called,reference frames,we talk about units in another video so,let's look at what a frame of reference,is,let's say this blue box thing is a car,and it's going 45 miles per hour,someone standing on the side of the road,would see it pass at 45 miles per hour,now if this yellow truck,is going 40 miles per hour,someone sitting in the yellow truck,would observe the blue car traveling at,5 miles per hour,how could the person on the side of the,road see the blue car traveling at 45,miles per hour and a person in the,yellow truck see the blue car moving at,five miles per hour,this is because both observers are using,different frames of reference,so let's go ahead and take a look at,that starting with the speed of the blue,car,the person on the side of the road is,using their frame of reference of being,at rest so relative to them the blue car,is moving at 45 miles per hour,to the person in this yellow truck which,remember is already going 40 miles per,hour,the blue car,is going 5 miles per hour,now let's do the exact same thing for,the speed of the yellow truck,so what is the speed of the yellow truck,for the observer on the side of the road,it's 40 miles per hour,and what do you think the speed of the,truck is for the person using their blue,car as the reference frame,well the blue car is moving at 45 miles,per hour and the truck is only moving at,40 miles per hour,so the speed of the yellow truck is,actually five miles per hour slower than,this reference frame because the blue,car,is already moving at 45 miles per hour,now you might be thinking but wait the,person on the side of the road isn't,really at rest,they're on the earth and the earth is,moving,you're completely correct,the person is at rest with respect to,the earth,and the earth is the most common frame,of reference that we use to an observer,in space who is not rotating with the,earth,the blue car is going 45 miles per hour,plus the speed of earth's rotation,and this is why frame of reference is so,important we just talked about one blue,car having three different velocities,depending what the frame of reference is,how would we communicate this to avoid,confusion,well we state the reference frame we're,using,the blue car is moving at five miles per,hour with respect to which i'll write as,wrt,the yellow truck,this tells us that the yellow truck is,our frame of reference,or we could say that the yellow truck,is moving at 40 miles per hour and the,blue car at 45 miles per hour with,respect to the earth,that way everyone is on the same page a,page which to be clear isn't a book that,relative to me is at rest

## Key points:
- A reference frame is the point of view that you observe and measure things from. It is used to help define the motion or position of an object.
- Two people can have different reference frames of the same situation. If this happens, they will observe the motion and position of an object differently.
- Units are a way to describe a measurement. They allow us to describe things, like an object’s speed, mass, or position, in a consistent way.
- Scientists need to communicate data in a clear way. They do this by sharing the units and reference frame they use to take measurements.

Let’s talk about how we tell how big or fast things are, and how we know if they move.([KidzSearch Wiki][1])

**Units**

Units help us say how big, long, or fast a thing is. We use "m" for how long, "kg" for how heavy, and "s" for time. So, if a box is 2 m long, we know its size. If a ball rolls 5 m in 2 s, we can say how fast it goes.([Legends of Learning][2], [PhysicsGoEasy][3], [KidzSearch Wiki][1])

**Frames**

A frame is like your spot to look from. If you sit on a bus and see a tree go by, you say the tree moves. But if you stand on the road, you say the bus moves. Both are right! It just depends on where you look from.([Wikipedia][4])

So, units tell us how much. Frames tell us from where. We need both to say what we see.([Oak National Academy][5], [WIRED][6])
