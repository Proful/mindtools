## Digital signals
in this video we're going to talk about,analog versus digital something that's,analog can be any value within a given,range while something digital is,represented by a number of discrete or,separate levels,to distinguish these two ideas i like to,think about clocks an analog clock has,the numbers in the hands and it's analog,because the motion of those hands is,continuous they can sweep across the,circle representing any of infinite,times on that clock for example between,306 and 307 the minute hand is actually,going to be at some point between those,marks on the clock,showing one of the infinitely possible,times that the clock can represent,compare that to a digital clock a,digital clock is only going to show you,306 or 307,it will never display any of the many,fractional seconds between those two,times,digital only takes on certain discrete,values and it has a finite number of,those values,so an analog waiver signal will smoothly,sweep across the infinitely many,possible values it has,while a digital waiver signal will only,be at one of a number of discrete values,so the shape of the wave will be more,square or step like,let's check out an example so this makes,a little more sense i like music so,we're going to talk about sound,sound is an analog signal or wave so if,we look at a graph of sound volume over,time it's going to have a smooth,continuous analog waveform both the,amplitude or the volume and the,frequency what we hear as pitch,are changing continuously between,infinite possible values all right and,that's because sound waves the vibration,of particles propagating through the air,actually changes continuously the very,first sound recording and reproduction,technology imprinted that analog wave,directly onto a material for example,records imprint that sound wave into,vinyl and cassettes and print the sound,wave onto tape,a major drawback of this technology is,that for the sound to play back exactly,as it was recorded that waveform needs,to stay untouched right so think about,scratching vinyl or stretching or,smudging a cassette tape that's directly,deforming the wave so you'll never be,able to reproduce the sound exactly as,it was recorded,so technology advanced and sound waves,became digitized here's how,alright so recall our analog sound wave,we have a smooth analog wave that's,taking on any number of infinitely,possible values within this range,in order to digitize this wave we're,going to describe numbers to the,amplitude at different points all right,watch as magic,so we go over here and make a scale so,we're breaking up the amplitudes into,discrete possibilities,then we can go through the wave and at,specific points of the wave measure what,is the amplitude based on that scale,so over here we're at the first point of,the scale,at this peak we're at the second point,of our scale then the first the third,the second the fourth,back down to the first,now that we have this wave broken up,into discrete levels right we can,ascribe the numbers and we effectively,turn this analog wave into a set of,numbers,one two one three two four one,our wave has been digitized,now that digitized wave can be played,back through a speaker to recreate the,analog wave as long as a sampling,happens at a quick enough rate humans,can't tell the difference,alright so the digitization of waves is,all about ascribing specific numbers to,some of those mechanical properties of,the wave,the important thing here is that now,that the wave has been digitized,the digitized sound wave can be reliably,stored processed and communicated with,computers,so some information is lost in,translation but once the wave is,digitized its quality will never degrade,okay and that allows for a lot more,reliable technology because the wave is,represented with numbers instead of it,being physically imprinted on some,material,so humans prefer to store information,like sound digitally and there are ways,to turn analog signals which can,represent any of infinite possible,values into digital information which is,useful because information is stored,only at a number of discrete or separate,levelsin this video we're going to think about,analog versus digital signals,and one way to think about the,difference is an analog signal is trying,to reproduce exactly in some type of a,signal what is going on while a digital,signal is converting it usually to ones,and zeros which then can be converted,back so the first thing to realize is,that almost any type of information it,might be how intense a certain color is,or how bright it is or it might be a,frequency of sound all of that can be,represented as numbers so whether you're,trying to transmit an analog signal or a,digital signal it really is about how do,you communicate numbers using some type,of signal and as an example let's say,that you are trying to communicate the,number 24 to someone well one way to do,it is as an analog signal,you could have as time goes on maybe,this is some type of voltage across a,wire and if you put that voltage right,at what the other person receiving it,could it interpret it as 24,well then you would transmit it and they,might if they get this nice clean signal,see it as a 24.,now the problem with analog signals is,what happens when you have interference,so let's say this is a really long wire,that you're transmitting it over or,you're transmitting it using radio waves,and there's a lot of bad weather or,other types of interference and so on,the receiving end,even though you transmit something that,looks like this that is a clear 24,the other person might get something,like this,and so this isn't obvious that is a 24,anymore it goes between 20 and 30 and,this could be interpreted as static or,garbled up message or just doesn't sound,as clean depending what the 24 is trying,to represent or the image isn't as clear,if this is representing say the the,lightness or the brightness of a pixel,now the other option is to convert that,24 into,binary,so 24 can be represented in binary as,one one,zero zero zero,now we have other videos on khan academy,that explain how to convert back and,forth between our decimal system that,has ten digits zero through nine and the,binary system which has two digits zero,and one but in case you're curious and,you don't have to understand this to,know the difference between analog and,digital signals and when they might be,useful this first place is the ones,place just as you're used to but instead,of this being the tens place this is the,two's place instead of this being the,hundreds place this is the fourth place,instead of this being the thousands,place this is the eighths place and,instead of that being the ten thousands,place that's the sixteens place,so one way to think about it one one,zero zero zero means one sixteen and one,eight and if you add those together you,would get twenty four,what would that actually look like as a,signal,well it could look something like this,where the person interpreting it knows,that over this first time period,whatever voltage you're getting that,tells you your first digit,then over the next time period whatever,voltage you're getting tells you the,second digit and so on and so forth so,this would be one one,zero zero zero,now why is this useful well let's think,about the situation where all of a,sudden there's interference again,now with the interference you could,still interpret this exactly as one one,zero zero zero remember the person,receiving the signal or the system,receiving the signal is just trying to,determine whether it's getting a one or,a zero so even though this is being,perturbed right over here it's clear,that we are at a one we know that it,would not be a point nine or one point,one it has to be either one or a zero so,it's clear that over,this part right over here you're getting,a one and then over here you're getting,three zeros so they would be able to,interpret it as one one zero zero zero,which is once again exactly twenty four

## Key points:
Information can be stored in digital or analog form. Digital information is made from a certain set of values, or digits. Analog information is made from possibilities within a range.
For example, a digital clock can show time with the exact values 
\[0\]-
\[9\]. But the hands on an analog clock can point to any value in the range from 
\[0\]-
\[12\].
Information in waves can be transmitted with either digital or analog signals using wave properties like frequency or amplitude.
The properties of a digital signal match specific values, or digits in their set of values.
The properties of an analog signal can be any value within a range.
Digital signals are more reliable because interference or noise can be easily removed from the received signal. However, every change within an analog signal contains some information, so interference or noise can be almost impossible to remove.
