## 1.  Introduction to Natural Resources

Everything that humans and other living organisms use to survive, grow, and live comes from **nature**. These natural materials and components are called **Natural Resources**.

They include:

* The **air** we breathe
* The **water** we drink
* The **food** we eat
* The **land** we live on
* The **forests** that provide wood and oxygen
* The **minerals** used to make tools, machines, and ornaments
* The **energy sources** like coal, petroleum, sunlight, and wind

Without natural resources, there would be no life on Earth.

**Definition:**
 *Natural resources are substances and materials that exist in nature and are used by humans and other living beings for survival and development.*

**Examples:**

* Sunlight for photosynthesis and solar energy
* Water for drinking and irrigation
* Coal and petroleum for fuel
* Forests for oxygen, food, and wood

---

## 2.  Types of Natural Resources

Natural resources can be classified in many ways. One of the most important ways is by **availability** or **regeneration capacity**.

### 2.1 Renewable Resources

These resources can be replenished naturally in a short period of time.

**Examples:**

* Sunlight
* Wind
* Forests (if managed well)
* Animals (if protected)
* Water (through the water cycle)

**Key Point:** Renewable does not mean *inexhaustible*. If misused, even renewable resources can be destroyed (e.g., forests cut without replanting).

---

### 2.2 Non-Renewable Resources

These resources take **millions of years** to form and once used up, they cannot be replaced in a human lifetime.

**Examples:**

* Coal
* Petroleum (oil)
* Natural Gas
* Minerals like gold, copper, iron

**Key Point:** Non-renewable resources are **limited** and must be used carefully.

---

## 3.  Classification Based on Origin

Natural resources can also be grouped into two categories based on their origin:

### 3.1 Biotic Resources

* Derived from living organisms
* Includes plants, animals, and products from them

**Examples:**

* Forests
* Fish and livestock
* Crops
* Wood

---

### 3.2 Abiotic Resources

* Derived from non-living things
* Includes sunlight, water, air, and minerals

**Examples:**

* Air
* Soil
* Minerals
* Sunlight

## 4.  Detailed Study of Key Natural Resources

This is the core of the topic. Let’s study each major natural resource in detail.

---

### ️ 4.1 Air

Air is a mixture of gases surrounding the Earth, forming the **atmosphere**.

**Composition of Air:**

* Nitrogen (78%)
* Oxygen (21%)
* Carbon dioxide, Argon, Water Vapour, and other gases (1%)

**Importance of Air:**

* Oxygen is essential for respiration.
* Carbon dioxide is used by plants for photosynthesis.
* Air regulates Earth’s temperature and weather.
* Air is used in wind energy and flight.

**Threats to Air:**

* Air pollution (smoke, vehicle emissions, factories)
* Ozone layer depletion
* Greenhouse gases causing global warming

---

###  4.2 Water

Water is essential for life. Without water, no living being can survive.

**Distribution of Water:**

* Oceans and seas – 97% (salty, not fit for drinking)
* Freshwater – 3% (rivers, lakes, glaciers, groundwater)

**Uses of Water:**

* Drinking and cooking
* Agriculture (irrigation)
* Industries and factories
* Hydroelectric power
* Transport (ships, boats)

**Threats:**

* Pollution (chemicals, plastics, sewage)
* Overuse and wastage
* Climate change causing droughts

---

###  4.3 Soil

Soil is the upper layer of Earth where plants grow. It is formed by the breakdown of rocks mixed with organic matter.

**Types of Soil:**

* Sandy soil – loose, drains water quickly
* Clayey soil – holds water, heavy
* Loamy soil – rich in nutrients, fertile

**Importance of Soil:**

* Basis of agriculture
* Supports plant growth
* Provides raw materials like clay and sand

**Problems:**

* Soil erosion (wind, rain washing away soil)
* Loss of fertility due to overuse of chemicals

---

###  4.4 Forests

Forests are large areas covered with trees and plants.

**Types of Forests:**

* Tropical rainforests
* Evergreen forests
* Deciduous forests

**Importance of Forests:**

* Provide oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide
* Source of wood, fruits, medicines
* Protect soil from erosion
* Home to wildlife

**Threats:**

* Deforestation
* Forest fires
* Urbanization

---

###  4.5 Wildlife

Wildlife refers to all animals living in their natural habitat.

**Examples:** Tigers, elephants, birds, insects, fishes

**Importance:**

* Maintains balance in ecosystems
* Supports food chain
* Source of tourism and cultural value

**Threats:**

* Poaching and hunting
* Habitat destruction
* Climate change

**Conservation Methods:**

* Wildlife sanctuaries
* National parks
* Wildlife protection laws

---

### ️ 4.6 Minerals

Minerals are naturally occurring substances found in the Earth’s crust.

**Examples:** Iron, gold, copper, bauxite, coal

**Uses:**

* Making tools, machinery, and buildings
* Jewellery (gold, diamonds)
* Electronics and electricity (copper wires)
* Fuel (coal, uranium)

**Problems:**

* Non-renewable, once finished cannot be replaced
* Mining damages environment

---

### ️ 4.7 Sunlight

Sunlight is an inexhaustible, renewable source of energy.

**Importance:**

* Provides heat and light
* Plants make food through photosynthesis
* Solar panels produce electricity
* Helps dry crops, clothes

---

### ️ 4.8 Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels are formed from remains of plants and animals buried for millions of years.

**Types:**

* Coal
* Petroleum (petrol, diesel)
* Natural gas

**Uses:**

* Energy for vehicles
* Cooking gas (LPG)
* Electricity generation

**Problems:**

* Non-renewable
* Cause pollution and global warming

---

## 5. Human Uses of Natural Resources

Humans depend on natural resources for:

* Food, clothing, and shelter
* Transport and communication
* Industries and economy
* Scientific inventions

---

## 6.  Importance of Natural Resources

* Essential for survival of all life
* Provide raw materials for industries
* Maintain ecological balance
* Support cultural and recreational activities

---

## 7. ️ Problems Caused by Overuse of Natural Resources

1. **Pollution** – air, water, and soil pollution
2. **Depletion** – overuse leading to shortage
3. **Habitat destruction** – cutting forests destroys homes of animals
4. **Climate change** – burning fossil fuels increases global warming

---

## 8.  Conservation of Natural Resources

**Principles:**

* Use resources wisely
* Avoid wastage
* Protect ecosystems

**Methods:**

* Afforestation
* Rainwater harvesting
* Using renewable energy
* Recycling waste

---

## 9. ️ The 3Rs Principle

* **Reduce** – use less
* **Reuse** – use again
* **Recycle** – convert waste into new products

---

## 10.  Sustainable Development

Sustainable development means using resources in a way that meets our needs **without harming the future generations’ ability to meet their needs**.

**Example:** Using solar and wind energy instead of only coal.

---

## 11. ️ Role of Government and International Organizations

* Governments make laws to protect forests and wildlife.
* International agreements (like Paris Agreement) aim to reduce climate change.
* NGOs create awareness about conservation.

---

## 12.  Future of Natural Resources

* If used carelessly → shortage, pollution, climate crisis.
* If conserved → resources last for future generations, Earth remains healthy.

---

## 13.  Summary

* Natural resources are gifts of nature, essential for life.
* They can be renewable or non-renewable, biotic or abiotic.
* Air, water, soil, forests, wildlife, minerals, sunlight, and fossil fuels are key resources.
* Overuse causes pollution and depletion.
* Conservation and sustainable development are the only way forward.
