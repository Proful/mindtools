#  **Rocks and Minerals**

The Earth we live on is made up of different layers. The outermost solid part is called the **crust**. This crust is made up of **rocks**. If you look around — at mountains, valleys, roads, and buildings — you’ll find that rocks are everywhere! But what are rocks really made of?

## What Are Rocks?

A **rock** is a natural solid substance that is made up of one or more **minerals**. Rocks form the Earth’s crust and provide the base on which plants grow, animals live, and humans build.

Some rocks are hard like granite, while others are soft like chalk. Rocks do not have a definite shape or size — they can be as small as pebbles or as big as mountains!

## What Are Minerals?

A **mineral** is a naturally occurring pure substance found in the Earth. It has a definite chemical composition and structure. Minerals are the building blocks of rocks.
Think of minerals like the ingredients in a cake — when different minerals come together, they form rocks.

### Examples of Common Minerals:

* **Quartz** – found in many rocks and used in making glass and watches.
* **Mica** – shiny and flaky mineral used in electrical appliances.
* **Feldspar** – one of the most common minerals in the Earth’s crust.
* **Calcite** – found in limestone and used in making cement.
* **Diamond** – the hardest known natural mineral, used in jewelry and cutting tools.

Different combinations of these minerals form different rocks. For example:

* **Granite** = Quartz + Feldspar + Mica
* **Marble** = made mainly of Calcite

#  **Types of Rocks**

Scientists classify rocks into **three main types**, based on how they were formed. These are:

1. **Igneous Rocks** – formed from cooled lava or magma.
2. **Sedimentary Rocks** – formed from layers of sand, clay, and dead remains.
3. **Metamorphic Rocks** – formed when other rocks change due to heat and pressure.

Let’s explore each type in detail.

#  **Igneous Rocks — The Fire Rocks**

The word *igneous* comes from the Latin word *“ignis”* meaning **fire**. Igneous rocks are called **fire rocks** because they are formed when **hot molten material** (called **magma**) from deep inside the Earth cools and solidifies.

### How Are Igneous Rocks Formed?

Deep inside the Earth, it is extremely hot — so hot that rocks melt and become a thick liquid called **magma**.
When this magma comes out through cracks or volcanoes, it is called **lava**.
When lava or magma cools down, it solidifies and forms **igneous rocks**.

### Two Types of Igneous Rocks:

1. **Intrusive (Plutonic) Igneous Rocks**

   * Formed when magma cools **slowly deep inside the Earth**.
   * Because cooling is slow, **large crystals** have time to form.
   * These rocks are **hard and coarse-grained**.
   * **Examples:** Granite, Diorite, Gabbro.

    *Example:* Granite is often used for making kitchen countertops and building monuments because of its strength and beauty.

2. **Extrusive (Volcanic) Igneous Rocks**

   * Formed when lava erupts from a volcano and cools **quickly on the Earth’s surface**.
   * Because cooling is fast, **small or no crystals** form.
   * These rocks are **fine-grained and sometimes glassy**.
   * **Examples:** Basalt, Obsidian, Pumice.

    *Did You Know?* Pumice is so light that it can float on water! It forms when gas bubbles get trapped inside lava as it cools.

### Characteristics of Igneous Rocks:

* Usually **hard** and **durable**.
* Do not contain **fossils** (since they form from hot molten material).
* Often **contain crystals** of different sizes.
* Usually found in **mountainous areas** and **volcanic regions**.

### Importance of Igneous Rocks:

* Provide raw materials like granite and basalt for construction.
* Contain valuable minerals like iron, nickel, and copper.
* Help scientists study the Earth’s interior and volcanic activity.

# ️ **Sedimentary Rocks — The Layered Rocks**

The word *sedimentary* comes from the Latin word *“sedimentum”* meaning **settling down**. These rocks are formed by the **accumulation and compression** of materials like sand, silt, clay, pebbles, and even dead plants and animals.

### How Are Sedimentary Rocks Formed?

1. **Weathering and Erosion:**
   Rocks on the Earth’s surface are broken down by wind, rain, and sunlight into tiny particles.

2. **Transportation:**
   These small pieces (called **sediments**) are carried away by rivers, wind, or glaciers.

3. **Deposition:**
   The sediments settle in **layers** at the bottom of rivers, lakes, or seas.

4. **Compaction and Cementation:**
   Over millions of years, these layers are **pressed and cemented** together to form **sedimentary rocks**.

### Examples of Sedimentary Rocks:

* **Sandstone** – made of sand grains; used in buildings.
* **Limestone** – made from shells and remains of sea animals; used in cement.
* **Shale** – made from clay; soft and easily breaks.
* **Conglomerate** – made from pebbles and sand pressed together.
* **Coal** – formed from dead plants buried millions of years ago.

### Characteristics of Sedimentary Rocks:

* Usually **soft** and **layered**.
* **May contain fossils** of plants and animals.
* Often **porous** (can hold water).
* Usually **found in plains, river valleys, and sea beds**.

### Importance of Sedimentary Rocks:

* Source of **fossils**, which tell us about ancient life.
* Provide **building materials** like limestone and sandstone.
* Contain **natural resources** like coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

 *Fun Fact:* The **Grand Canyon** in the USA is made of colorful layers of sedimentary rocks — each layer tells a story from Earth’s history!

#  **Metamorphic Rocks — The Changed Rocks**

The word *metamorphic* comes from Greek words meaning **“change in form.”** These rocks are formed when **existing rocks** (igneous or sedimentary) are changed by **heat, pressure, or chemical action**.

This process happens **deep inside the Earth**, where temperatures and pressures are very high.

### How Are Metamorphic Rocks Formed?

When rocks are buried deep under the Earth or near molten magma, they face **extreme heat and pressure**.
These conditions **change their structure, texture, and minerals** — turning them into a completely new kind of rock.

For example:

* Limestone → **Marble**
* Shale → **Slate**
* Granite → **Gneiss**
* Sandstone → **Quartzite**

### Characteristics of Metamorphic Rocks:

* **Hard and dense**.
* Often show **banding or layers** of minerals.
* Do not contain fossils (heat destroys organic remains).
* Resistant to erosion and weathering.

### Examples and Uses:

* **Marble** – used for statues and flooring (e.g., Taj Mahal).
* **Slate** – used for roofing and blackboards.
* **Gneiss** – used in construction.
* **Quartzite** – very hard; used in road building.

 *Interesting Fact:* The transformation of rocks from one type to another is part of the **rock cycle** — a natural process that constantly recycles Earth’s materials.

---

# ️ **The Rock Cycle**

The **rock cycle** is the continuous process of formation, breaking down, and reforming of rocks.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Magma cools** → forms **igneous rocks**.
2. Igneous rocks **break down** → form **sediments**.
3. Sediments get **compressed** → form **sedimentary rocks**.
4. Sedimentary or igneous rocks **change under heat and pressure** → form **metamorphic rocks**.
5. Metamorphic rocks **melt again** → form **magma**, and the cycle continues!

The rock cycle shows that rocks are never destroyed — they just keep changing form over millions of years.

#  **Wealth from Rocks**

Rocks are not just lifeless pieces of Earth — they are full of treasures! The things we extract from rocks are called **minerals**, and these minerals are the **wealth of the Earth**.

### 1. **Metals from Rocks (Ores)**

Some rocks contain **metallic minerals**, which are extracted as **ores**. These ores are processed to obtain pure metals used in daily life.

| Metal     | Ore                 | Uses                                    |

### 3. **Fossil Fuels**

Some sedimentary rocks contain **fossil fuels**, which are ancient sources of energy formed from decayed plants and animals over millions of years.

* **Coal:** Used for electricity and heating.
* **Petroleum:** Source of petrol, diesel, kerosene.
* **Natural Gas:** Used for cooking and electricity generation.

These fuels are called **non-renewable resources**, because they take millions of years to form and can get exhausted.

 *Tip for Students:* Always remember — we must use these fuels wisely to protect our environment!

### 4. **Precious Stones**

Some minerals are rare, beautiful, and valuable — these are called **gemstones**.

| Gemstone | Mineral Source | Color         | Use                    |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Diamond  | Carbon         | Colorless     | Jewelry, cutting tools |
| Ruby     | Corundum       | Red           | Jewelry                |
| Sapphire | Corundum       | Blue          | Jewelry                |
| Emerald  | Beryl          | Green         | Jewelry                |
| Opal     | Silica         | Multi-colored | Decorative             |

Gemstones are polished and used in ornaments. They also help scientists study how minerals form deep inside Earth.
