# **Human Body and Its Functioning**

---

## **Section 1: Introduction to the Human Body**

* The **respiratory system** supplies oxygen.
* The **circulatory system** carries this oxygen to all body parts.
* The **muscular system** uses this oxygen to move.
* The **nervous system** controls when and how muscles move.

---

## **Section 2: Levels of Organization in the Human Body**

### **1. Cells – The Building Blocks of Life**

  * A **cell** is the smallest living unit of the body.
  * Our body has about **37 trillion cells**.
  * Different types of cells perform different jobs.

    * Example: **Red blood cells** carry oxygen.
    * Example: **Nerve cells** transmit messages.
    * Example: **Muscle cells** help in movement.

### **2. Tissues – Groups of Cells**

When similar cells join together to perform a function, they form a **tissue**.

The human body has **four main types of tissues**:

1. **Epithelial tissue** – Covers body surfaces and lines organs (e.g., skin).
2. **Muscle tissue** – Helps in movement (e.g., biceps).
3. **Nervous tissue** – Transmits messages (e.g., brain and spinal cord).
4. **Connective tissue** – Supports and connects body parts (e.g., bone, blood, fat).

### **3. Organs – Groups of Tissues**

Different tissues combine to form an **organ**.

* Example: The **heart** is made of muscle tissue (to pump), connective tissue (to hold it together), and nervous tissue (to control heartbeat).

Other examples: **lungs, brain, stomach, kidneys**.

### **4. Organ Systems – Groups of Organs**

Organs do not work alone. Several organs together form an **organ system**.

* Example: The **digestive system** includes mouth, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, etc.
* Example: The **respiratory system** includes nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm.

### **5. The Whole Organism**

Finally, all organ systems together form the **human body**.
This organization can be summarized as:

**Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ System → Human Body**

# **Section 3: Skeletal System**

The skeletal system is made up of **bones, joints, ligaments, and cartilage**. Together, these parts support the body, protect delicate organs, and help us move.

---

![skeletal](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-02-skel.jpg)

--- 

## **Parts of the Skeletal System**

### **1. Bones**

The human skeleton is made up of **bones**, which give our body **shape and support**. Without bones, we would not be able to stand upright, walk, or even sit.

**Number of bones**:

  * **Babies** are born with about **270 bones**.
  * As they grow, many bones **fuse (join together)**, so **adults** have **206 bones** in total.

Bones are **living tissue**, not dead material. They have their own **blood vessels and nerves**, which means they can:

  * Grow during childhood.
  * Repair themselves if broken (though sometimes they need help with a plaster cast).

The outer part of bones is **hard and strong**, but the inside is often **spongy** and filled with **bone marrow**.

  * **Red bone marrow** makes **red blood cells** (which carry oxygen) and **white blood cells** (which fight diseases).
  * **Yellow bone marrow** stores **fat**, which gives the body energy.

Bones are attached to muscles with the help of **tendons**, allowing us to **move**.

**Enamel**, found on teeth, is the **hardest substance in the body**. Although teeth are not bones, they are closely related because both are made of minerals like **calcium**.

---

![joints](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-03-joints.png)

--- 

### **2. Joints**

* A **joint** is the place where **two or more bones meet**.
* Joints are important because they give our body **movement** and **flexibility**. Without joints, our skeleton would be stiff like a single solid stick!
* Joints are held together by **ligaments** (strong bands of tissue that connect bone to bone) and protected by **cartilage** (a smooth, rubbery covering that stops bones from rubbing against each other).
* Inside most joints, there is a slippery fluid called **synovial fluid** that works like oil in a machine, helping the bones move smoothly.

#### **Types of Joints**

##### 1. **Ball-and-socket joints**

  * Structure: One bone has a round end (ball) that fits into a cup-shaped socket of another bone.
  * Movement: Can move in **all directions** (forward, backward, sideways, and in circles).
  * Examples: **Shoulder** and **hip joints**.

##### 2. **Hinge joints**

  * Structure: Works like the hinge of a door.
  * Movement: Allow movement in **only one direction** – forward and backward.
  * Examples: **Knee** and **elbow joints**.

##### 3. **Pivot joints**

  * Structure: One bone rotates around another.
  * Movement: Allow **rotation** (twisting movement).
  * Example: **Neck joint** (helps us turn the head side to side).

##### 4. **Gliding joints**

  * Structure: Flat or slightly curved bones that slide against each other.
  * Movement: Allow bones to **slide over one another**, giving flexibility.
  * Examples: **Wrist** and **ankle joints**.

##### 5. **Fixed joints** (also called immovable joints)

  * Structure: Bones are joined tightly and **cannot move**.
  * Purpose: Give **protection and strength**.
  * Example: **Skull bones** (they protect the brain).

---

![ligaments](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-04-ligaments.png)

---

### **3. Ligaments**
  * **Ligaments** are strong, **elastic bands of connective tissue** that join **bone to bone**.
  * They act like **tough ropes or straps**, holding bones together at a joint.
  * Their main job is to **stabilize joints**, making sure bones don’t move too far apart or in the wrong direction.
  * While **ligaments are strong**, they are also **slightly stretchy**, which allows safe movement and flexibility.
  * If a ligament is stretched too much or torn, it causes a **sprain** (common in ankles and knees).
  * Ligaments work **together with tendons**:

    * **Ligaments** → connect **bone to bone**.
    * **Tendons** → connect **muscle to bone**.

--- 

### **4. Cartilage**

  * **Cartilage** is a **soft, smooth, and flexible connective tissue** found in many parts of the body.
  * It covers the **ends of bones at joints**, acting like a **cushion or shock absorber** so that bones don’t rub directly against each other.
  * This helps in:
    * **Reducing friction** between bones.
    * **Preventing wear and tear** of bones.
    * **Allowing smooth movement** at joints.

  * Cartilage is also found in other parts of the body:
    * **Nose** → gives shape and flexibility.
    * **Ears** → makes them bendable but firm.
    * **Windpipe (trachea)** → supported by rings of cartilage so it doesn’t collapse while breathing.

  * Unlike bones, cartilage does **not have blood vessels**. This means it heals **much more slowly** if damaged.
  * In babies, much of the skeleton is made of cartilage. As they grow, most of this cartilage slowly turns into **bone** in a process called **ossification**.

![skeletal](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-02-skel.jpg)

---

## **Bone Health**

To keep bones healthy and strong:

* Eat foods rich in **calcium** (milk, cheese, leafy vegetables).
* Get enough **vitamin D** (sunlight, fish, eggs).
* Do regular **exercise** to strengthen bones and muscles.
* Avoid accidents by protecting joints during sports.

---

## **Interesting Facts about Bones**

* **Skull** – Protects the brain; made of 22 bones.
* **Spinal column (vertebrae)** – Made of 33 small bones stacked on top of each other. It protects the spinal cord and gives flexibility. It is flexible enough to let us bend and twist.
* **Ribs** – 12 pairs of ribs form a cage around the chest.**Ribs** protect the heart and lungs.
* **Femur** – The thigh bone; the longest and strongest bone in the body.
* **Humerus** – Upper arm bone.
* **Tibia and Fibula** – Lower leg bones.
* **Clavicle (collar bone)** – Connects the arm to the body.
* **Pelvis** – Large bone at the base of the spine, supports the lower body.
* The **smallest bone** in the body is the **stapes** in the ear.
* Bones are **five times stronger than steel** of the same weight.
* Bones keep growing in length until around **18–20 years of age**.
* The human hand has **27 bones**, and the foot has **26 bones**.
* About **half of all the bones** in the body are found in the **hands and feet**.
* Bones are **lightweight**, even though they are very strong—this makes movement easier.
* Bones constantly **renew themselves**: the skeleton is completely replaced about every **10 years**.
* The jawbone (mandible) is the **strongest bone** in the human body.
* Teeth are not bones, but both are made mostly of **calcium**.

# **Section 4: Muscular System**

The **muscular system** is what makes our body move. While bones provide structure, it is the **muscles** that pull and push those bones to create motion. Without muscles, we would not be able to walk, run, smile, or even blink.

The human body has **more than 600 muscles**, and they make up nearly **40–50% of our body weight**.

---

## **Types of Muscles**

There are three main types of muscles in the human body:

### **1. Skeletal Muscles (Voluntary Muscles)**

![voluntary](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-05-voluntary.png)

  * **Skeletal muscles** are the muscles that are attached to **bones** through **tendons**.
  * They are called **voluntary muscles** because we can **control them with our will**. For example, when we decide to walk, run, smile, or write, we are using voluntary muscles.
  * Skeletal muscles usually work in **pairs** so that movements are smooth and controlled.
  * When one muscle in the pair **contracts (tightens)**, the other **relaxes (loosens)**.

  - **Example: Arm Muscles**
    * To bend the elbow: **Biceps contract**, pulling the forearm up.
    * To straighten the elbow: **Triceps contract**, pulling the forearm down.

  * Skeletal muscles are very important because they allow us to:
    * **Move our body** (arms, legs, fingers, etc.)
    * **Maintain posture** (stand, sit upright)
    * **Perform daily activities** like eating, writing, and playing.

---

### **2. Smooth Muscles (Involuntary Muscles)**

![smooth](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-06-smooth.jpg)

  * **Smooth muscles** are found inside the walls of many **internal organs** such as the **stomach, intestines, bladder, and blood vessels**.
  * They are called **involuntary muscles** because they work **automatically**, without us having to think about it or control them.
    * Example: You don’t need to tell your stomach muscles to squeeze food—it happens on its own.

  * These muscles are generally **slow in action** but can work for **long periods without getting tired**.
  * In **blood vessels**, smooth muscles contract or relax to control the **flow of blood and blood pressure**.
  * In the **bladder**, smooth muscles help store and release urine.

---

### **3. Cardiac Muscle**

![cardiac](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-07-cardiac.jpg)

* **Cardiac muscle** is a special type of muscle found **only in the heart**.
* It is an **involuntary muscle**, which means we cannot control it consciously. The heart keeps beating automatically, even when we are asleep.
* Cardiac muscle fibers look a little like **skeletal muscles** but they work like **smooth muscles** (they never stop and don’t get tired).
* The heart contracts and relaxes in a **rhythmic pattern**, which pumps blood to every part of the body.
* **Strong contractions** → push blood with force so it reaches all body parts.
* **Rhythmic and automatic** → keeps a steady heartbeat.
* **Endurance** → works nonstop from birth until the end of life, without resting.
* Beats about **100,000 times a day** (around 70–80 times per minute in an adult).

---

## **Muscle Health**

To keep muscles healthy:

* Eat foods rich in **protein** (milk, eggs, fish, beans).
* Stretch muscles to avoid cramps.

---

## **Disorders of Muscles**

* **Muscle cramps** – Sudden, painful tightening of muscles due to dehydration or fatigue.
* **Muscular dystrophy** – Weakening of muscles (genetic condition).
* **Strains and sprains** – Overstretching or tearing of muscle fibers or ligaments.

---

## **Interesting Facts about Muscles**

* The **largest muscle** is the **gluteus maximus** in the buttocks.
* The **smallest muscle** is the **stapedius** in the ear, which helps control sound vibrations.
* The **strongest muscle** (by force) is the **masseter muscle** in the jaw, used for chewing.
* It takes **17 muscles to smile** and **43 muscles to frown**. So, smiling is easier!
* The **eye muscles** are the fastest and most active, moving more than 10,000 times a day.
* The human body has over **600 muscles**, making up about **40–50% of total body weight**.
* Muscles can only **pull**, not push. They work in **pairs** to move bones.
* The **tongue** is made of several muscles and is the most **flexible muscle** in the body.
* Even when you’re asleep, muscles like the **diaphragm** keep working to help you breathe.
* Shivering happens when muscles **rapidly contract and relax** to produce heat and keep the body warm.
* Muscles need **oxygen and glucose** to work, which is why you breathe faster when you exercise.
* The heart’s **cardiac muscle** is the only muscle that **never rests**—it works your whole life without getting tired.

---

# **Section 5: Digestive System – The Journey of Food**

The **digestive system** is the set of organs and processes that break down the food we eat into nutrients that the body can absorb and use for energy, growth, and repair.

Food gives us:

* **Carbohydrates** → energy
* **Proteins** → growth and repair
* **Fats** → stored energy and insulation
* **Vitamins & Minerals** → regulation of body functions
* **Water** → transport of nutrients and waste

But food is usually in a form that the body cannot directly use. That’s why digestion is essential.

---

## **Main Functions of the Digestive System**

1. **Ingestion** – Taking in food and drink.
2. **Digestion** – Breaking down food into smaller molecules (mechanical + chemical).
3. **Absorption** – Nutrients pass into the blood.
4. **Assimilation** – Cells use nutrients for energy, growth, repair.
5. **Egestion** – Removal of undigested food (faeces).

---

![digestive](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-08-digestive.jpg)

---

## **The Human Digestive System: Step-by-Step Journey of Food**

### **1. Mouth (Oral Cavity)**

  * The first step in digestion begins in the mouth.
  * **Teeth** break down food into small pieces (mechanical digestion).
    * Incisors → cut food.
    * Canines → tear food.
    * Premolars & molars → grind food.

  * **Saliva**, produced by **salivary glands**, mixes with food.
    * Saliva contains **amylase enzyme**, which starts breaking down starch into sugar.

  * The tongue helps in mixing food and pushing it into the throat.

The food becomes a soft ball called a **bolus**.

---

### **2. Pharynx and Esophagus**

* After we **chew food** in the mouth, it goes to the **pharynx** (throat). The pharynx is like a **pathway** that helps food move from the mouth to the food pipe.
* From the throat, food enters the **esophagus**, also called the **food pipe**.
* The esophagus carries the food **down to the stomach**, where digestion continues.

---

### **3. Stomach**

  * A muscular, J-shaped organ where food is churned and mixed with digestive juices.
  * The stomach secretes:
    * **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)** → kills germs, creates acidic medium.
    * **Pepsin enzyme** → breaks proteins into smaller peptides.
    * **Mucus** → protects the stomach lining from acid.

  * Food is churned into a semi-liquid mixture called **chyme**.

Example: A sandwich eaten at lunch is churned into chyme within 2–4 hours.

---

### **4. Small Intestine**

* The **small intestine** is the **main part of digestion** where food is broken down completely and useful substances are absorbed.
* It is a **long, coiled tube (about 6 meters long)** inside our belly.

#### **What happens in the small intestine?**

  * Juices from the **liver**, **pancreas**, and the **small intestine itself** mix with food and **break it down into very simple forms** that the body can use.
  * For example:
    * Starches → change into **sugar**. Starches are a type of carbohydrate found in many foods we eat.
    * Proteins → change into **amino acids** (building blocks for growth).
    * Fats → change into **tiny particles** that can be absorbed.

#### **Absorption of nutrients**

  * The inner wall of the small intestine has many tiny **finger-like shapes** called **villi**.
  * These villi make a **large surface area**, which helps the small intestine **absorb as much food as possible**.
  * After digestion:
    * **Sugars, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals** go into the **blood**.
    * **Fats** go into another fluid called **lymph**.

  * From here, these nutrients travel all around the body to give us **energy, strength, and repair**.

---

### **5. Large Intestine**

* About 1.5 meters long.
* Main role: **Absorbs water and minerals** from undigested food.
* Harmless bacteria in the large intestine help in producing vitamins like **Vitamin K**.
* Waste material becomes semi-solid (faeces).

---

### **6. Rectum and Anus**

* The rectum stores faeces.
* Waste is removed from the body through the **anus**.
* This process is called **egestion** (not excretion – because excretion is removal of liquid/gaseous waste like urine and sweat).

---

![digestive accessory](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-09-digestive-accessory.jpg)

---

## **Accessory Organs of Digestion**

### 1. **Liver**
  * Largest internal organ.
  * Produces **bile**, stored in the **gallbladder**.
  * Helps in fat digestion.
  * Also stores glycogen and detoxifies harmful substances.

### 2. **Pancreas**
  * Produces **pancreatic juice** rich in enzymes.
  * Secretes **insulin hormone** which controls blood sugar levels.

### 3. **Gallbladder**
  * Small organ under the liver.
  * Stores and releases bile when needed.

---

## **Timeline of Digestion**

* Mouth: seconds to 1 minute.
* Esophagus: 5–10 seconds.
* Stomach: 2–4 hours.
* Small intestine: 3–6 hours.
* Large intestine: 10–12 hours.
* Total digestion: \~24–36 hours.

---

## **Disorders of Digestive System**

1. **Indigestion** – Improper breakdown of food; causes discomfort.
2. **Diarrhea** – Watery stools due to infection/food poisoning.
3. **Constipation** – Difficulty in passing stools due to lack of fiber.
4. **Ulcers** – Sores in stomach lining due to excess acid.
5. **Jaundice** – Liver infection; skin and eyes turn yellow.

---

## **How to Keep Digestive System Healthy**

* Eat a **balanced diet** (fruits, vegetables, fiber, water).
* Avoid overeating and junk food.
* Chew food properly.
* Wash hands before eating (to prevent germs).

---

## **Interesting Facts about Digestion**

* The stomach produces **2–3 liters of gastric juice daily**.
* Your **small intestine is longer than your height**.
* The liver performs **500+ functions**, not just digestion.
* If unfolded, the surface area of the small intestine would cover a **tennis court**.
* Digestion uses up about **10% of the body’s energy**.

---

# **Section 6: Respiratory System – Breathing and Gas Exchange**

Breathing is one of the most vital processes of life. We can live without food for weeks, without water for days, but without oxygen for only a few minutes. The **respiratory system** ensures that oxygen reaches every cell of the body and that waste carbon dioxide is removed.

---

## **Why Do We Need Oxygen?**

* Every cell in our body performs a process called **cellular respiration**.
* In this process, **oxygen** combines with **glucose** (sugar from food) to release **energy (ATP)**.
* Waste products formed: **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and **water (H₂O)**.

The equation for cellular respiration is:

Glucose + Oxygen --> Energy (ATP) + Carbon dioxide + Water

This energy is used for walking, thinking, pumping blood, digestion, muscle contraction – in fact, **all life processes**.

---

## **Main Functions of the Respiratory System**

1. **Breathing (Ventilation)** – Taking in oxygen (inhalation) and giving out carbon dioxide (exhalation).
2. **Gas Exchange** – Oxygen moves into the blood, carbon dioxide moves out.
3. **Transport of Gases** – Oxygen carried to cells, carbon dioxide carried to lungs.
4. **Cellular Respiration** – Energy release in mitochondria of cells.

---

![respiratory](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-10-respiratory.jpg)

---

## **Parts of the Human Respiratory System**

The human respiratory system is like a **network of airways, organs, and muscles** that work together.

### **1. Nose and Nasal Cavity**

* Air enters mainly through the nose.
* Nose has **hair and mucus** that trap dust, germs, and harmful particles.
* Nasal cavity warms and moistens the air.
* Smell receptors also present here.

Breathing through the nose is healthier than breathing through the mouth.

---

### **2. Pharynx (Throat)**

* A muscular tube connecting the nose and mouth to the larynx.
* Both food and air pass through pharynx.
* Epiglottis ensures food goes to esophagus and air goes to trachea.

---

### **3. Larynx (Voice Box)**

* Located at the top of trachea.
* Contains **vocal cords** that vibrate to produce sound when air passes.
* Helps us speak, sing, and produce different tones.

---

### **4. Trachea (Windpipe)**

* Trachea is a tube that connects the throat (larynx/voice box) to the lungs.
* Its main job is to carry air in and out of the lungs while breathing.
* Surrounded by **C-shaped cartilage rings** that keep it open.
* Inner lining has mucus and cilia to trap dust and move it upward.

---

### **5. Bronchi and Bronchioles**

* Trachea divides into two **bronchi** (one for each lung).
* Each bronchus branches into smaller tubes called **bronchioles** inside the lung.
* Bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called **alveoli**.

---

### **6. Lungs**

The **lungs** are the **main organs of the respiratory system**. Their job is to **help us breathe** and supply oxygen to the body while removing carbon dioxide.

---

![lungs](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-17-lungs.jpg)

---

#### **Location and Protection**

* The lungs are present inside the **chest cavity**.
* They are protected by the **ribcage**
* The **diaphragm**, a dome-shaped muscle below the lungs, plays a major role in breathing.

#### **Structure**

* The **right lung** has **3 lobes** (upper, middle, lower).
* The **left lung** has **2 lobes** (upper, lower). It is slightly smaller because the **heart** is located on the left side.
* Each lung is covered by a **thin double-layered membrane called the pleura**. Between its two layers, there is a fluid that reduces **friction**, so the lungs can expand and contract smoothly during breathing.

#### **Air Passage Inside Lungs**

1. Air enters the lungs through the **trachea (windpipe)**.
2. The trachea divides into two **bronchi** (one to each lung).
3. Each bronchus divides into smaller **bronchioles**, like the branches of a tree.
4. At the end of bronchioles are tiny air sacs called **alveoli**.

#### **Functions of the Lungs**

* Take in **oxygen** and supply it to the blood.
* Remove **carbon dioxide** from the body.
* Help regulate the body’s **pH balance**.
* Provide **voice and sound production** (as air passes through the vocal cords).

--- 

### **7. Alveoli**

* The alveoli are tiny balloon-like sacs where **gas exchange** happens.
* Provide a huge surface area for gas exchange (as large as a tennis court!).
* They have very thin walls and are surrounded by **capillaries (tiny blood vessels)**.
* **Oxygen** from the air passes into the blood, and **carbon dioxide** from the blood passes into the alveoli to be exhaled.
* Each lung has about **300–500 million alveoli**.

---

### **8. Diaphragm and Intercostal Muscles**

* **Diaphragm**: Dome-shaped muscle at bottom of chest cavity.
* **Intercostal muscles**: Found between ribs.
* Both work together to expand and contract the chest, helping in inhalation and exhalation.

---

## **Mechanism of Breathing**

Breathing is an **involuntary process**, but we can also control it (like holding breath).

### **Inhalation (Breathing In)**

1. Diaphragm contracts and moves downward.
2. Intercostal muscles pull ribs upward and outward.
3. Chest cavity expands → pressure decreases.
4. Air rushes into lungs because external air pressure is higher.

---

### **Exhalation (Breathing Out)**

1. Diaphragm relaxes and moves upward.
2. Ribs move downward and inward.
3. Chest cavity reduces → pressure increases.
4. Air is pushed out of lungs.

---

## **Respiration vs Breathing**

* **Breathing**: Physical process of inhaling and exhaling air.
* **Respiration**: Cellular process where glucose is broken down with oxygen to release energy.

Olympiad Trick: All respiration requires breathing, but breathing itself is not respiration.

---

## **Common Disorders of Respiratory System**

1. **Asthma** – Narrowing of airways → difficulty in breathing.
2. **Pneumonia** – Infection of lungs by bacteria/virus.
3. **Tuberculosis (TB)** – Infectious disease caused by bacteria.
4. **Lung cancer** – Often due to smoking.
5. **Common cold** – Viral infection of nose and throat.

---

## **How to Keep Lungs Healthy**

* Avoid smoking and polluted air.
* Exercise regularly (increases lung capacity).
* Eat foods rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants.
* Practice breathing exercises (like yoga’s pranayama).

---

## **Interesting Facts about Breathing**

* An average person breathes **12–20 times per minute**.
* In a lifetime, we breathe about **500 million times**.
* We inhale about **11,000 liters of air every day**.
* Right lung is bigger than left lung (left makes space for heart).
* Hiccups are caused by sudden contraction of diaphragm.

---

# **Section 7: Circulatory System – Transport of Blood and Nutrients**

It ensures:

* **Delivery of oxygen and nutrients** to cells.
* **Removal of wastes** like carbon dioxide and urea.
* **Transport of hormones** for coordination.
* **Defense against diseases** through white blood cells.
* **Maintenance of body temperature** and balance of fluids.

Without circulation, cells would die quickly, as they cannot move to get food or oxygen on their own.

---

## **Main Components of Circulatory System**

1. **Heart** – the pumping organ.
2. **Blood** – the transport fluid.
3. **Blood vessels** – the network of tubes (arteries, veins, capillaries).

---

## **The Heart – The Pump of Life**

The **heart** is a muscular organ located slightly to the left in the chest, protected by the ribcage.

* Size: about the size of a fist.
* Beats: about **70–80 times per minute** in adults.
* Pumps: around **5 liters of blood per minute**.
* In a lifetime: more than **2.5 billion beats**!

---

![heart](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-11-heart.png)

---

## **Structure of the Heart**

The **heart** is a strong, muscular organ that works as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It is located slightly towards the left side of the chest, protected by the rib cage, and is about the size of a clenched fist.

### **Chambers of the Heart**

The heart is divided into **four chambers** which work together to ensure proper circulation of blood:

#### 1. **Right Atrium**

  * Thin-walled upper chamber on the right side.
  * It **receives deoxygenated blood** (blood low in oxygen, rich in carbon dioxide) from the body through two large veins:
    * **Superior vena cava** (brings blood from upper body).
    * **Inferior vena cava** (brings blood from lower body).

  * From here, blood passes into the right ventricle through a valve.

#### 2. **Right Ventricle**

  * A muscular lower chamber.
  * It **pumps deoxygenated blood** to the **lungs** through the **pulmonary artery**.
  * In the lungs, carbon dioxide is removed and oxygen is absorbed.
  * The wall of the right ventricle is thicker than the right atrium because it needs more force to push blood to the lungs.

#### 3. **Left Atrium**

  * Located on the upper left side of the heart.
  * It **receives oxygenated blood** (rich in oxygen) from the lungs through **pulmonary veins**.
  * Blood then flows into the left ventricle through another valve.

#### 4. **Left Ventricle**

  * The **largest and strongest chamber** of the heart.
  * It **pumps oxygenated blood** to the entire body through the **aorta** (the largest artery).
  * Since it has to push blood with great force to reach all body parts, the **wall of the left ventricle is the thickest** among all chambers.

---

### **Valves in the Heart**

  * Valves act like **one-way doors**.
  * Prevent backflow of blood.

---

### **Circulation Pathway**

The human heart and blood vessels form a **closed circulatory system**, meaning blood flows through vessels and does not leave them. There are **two main types of circulation**, which work together to complete the cycle of blood flow:

---

#### **1. Pulmonary Circulation (lungs)**

  * **Pathway**:
     * **Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary vein → Left atrium**

  * **Process**:
    * The **right ventricle** pumps **deoxygenated blood** (low in oxygen, high in carbon dioxide) into the **pulmonary artery**.
    * This blood goes to the **lungs**, where **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** is released from the blood and **oxygen (O₂)** is absorbed.
    * The now **oxygen-rich blood** returns to the **left atrium** of the heart through the **pulmonary veins**.

  * **Function**:
    Ensures **exchange of gases** – removes CO₂ and adds O₂ to the blood.

---

#### **2. Systemic Circulation (body)**

  * **Pathway**:
    * **Left ventricle → Aorta → Body organs → Veins → Right atrium**

  * **Process**:
    * The **left ventricle** pumps **oxygenated blood** into the **aorta** (the largest artery).
    * From the aorta, blood is distributed to all parts of the body through smaller arteries.
    * Body cells **use oxygen and nutrients** from the blood and release **carbon dioxide and wastes**.
    * The deoxygenated blood is carried back by **veins** and enters the **right atrium** through the **vena cavae** (superior and inferior).

  * **Function**:
    Supplies **oxygen, nutrients, and hormones** to body cells and collects waste products (like CO₂).

---

## **Heartbeat**

The heartbeat is the **regular squeezing and relaxing movement** of the heart that keeps blood moving in the body.

### **How it happens (sequence):**

  1. First, the **upper chambers (atria)** squeeze and push blood down into the **lower chambers (ventricles)**.
  2. Then, the **lower chambers (ventricles)** squeeze strongly and pump blood out –
    * to the **lungs** (for oxygen), and
    * to the **rest of the body** (to supply oxygen and food).

### **Heartbeat sound: "lub-dub"**

* **"Lub"** → happens when the doors between the upper and lower chambers **shut tightly** after blood moves down.
* **"Dub"** → happens when the doors at the exits of the heart **shut tightly** after blood is pumped out.

These two sounds together make the **heartbeat sound** doctors hear with a stethoscope.

### **Heartbeat rate**

* In a normal adult: **70–80 beats per minute** (like ticking of a clock).
* In children: the heartbeat is **faster** because their bodies need more energy as they grow.

## **Blood – The Transport Fluid**

Blood is a **red-colored liquid** that flows through our blood vessels. It is the main transport system of our body, carrying oxygen, food, hormones, and removing wastes. Blood is made up of **two parts**:

1. **Plasma (55%)** – the liquid part
2. **Formed elements (45%)** – the solid parts (RBCs, WBCs, Platelets)

---

### **1. Plasma (55%)**

  * Plasma is the **pale yellow fluid** that makes up more than half of blood.
  * It is about **90–92% water**, the rest being proteins, salts, hormones, nutrients, and wastes.
  * **Main functions:**
    * Carries nutrients (like glucose, amino acids, vitamins) to body cells.
    * Transports hormones and enzymes.
    * Removes waste products like urea and carbon dioxide.
    * Maintains body temperature and balance of water and salts.

---

### **2. Red Blood Cells (RBCs / Erythrocytes)**

  * The most **numerous cells** in blood (millions in a single drop!).
  * They contain **hemoglobin**, a red pigment that binds to oxygen and gives blood its red color.
  * **Functions:**
    * Carry oxygen from lungs to all parts of the body.
    * Carry carbon dioxide back from tissues to lungs.

  * **Special features:**
    * No nucleus in humans → gives more space to store hemoglobin.
    * Produced in the **bone marrow**.
    * Lifespan is about **120 days**, after which old RBCs are destroyed in the liver and spleen (called the "graveyard of RBCs").

---

### **3. White Blood Cells (WBCs / Leukocytes)**

  * Fewer in number compared to RBCs, but **larger in size**.
  * They have a **nucleus** (unlike RBCs).
  * **Main function:** Defend the body against infections and diseases.
    * Make antibodies.
    * Engulf and destroy germs.
    * Protect against bacteria, parasites, and allergies.

---

### **4. Platelets (Thrombocytes)**

* Small, irregularly shaped cell fragments (not full cells).
* **Function:** Help in **blood clotting**.
  * When we get a cut, platelets form a plug and release chemicals that stop bleeding.
  * This prevents excessive blood loss and protects the body from infection.

* Very short lifespan (about **7–10 days**).

---

### **Functions of Blood**

* Transport oxygen (by hemoglobin).
* Carry carbon dioxide to lungs.
* Deliver nutrients (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids).
* Carry hormones to target organs.
* Regulate body temperature.
* Protect against infections.
* Heal wounds through clotting.

---

## **Blood Vessels – The Transport Network**

Blood moves through the body inside **tubes called blood vessels**. These vessels form a vast network that reaches every part of the body. There are **three main types of blood vessels**:

---

### **1. Arteries**

* Arteries carry blood **away from the heart** to different body parts.
* Their walls are **thick, strong, and elastic** to withstand the **high pressure** of blood pumped by the heart.
* Almost all arteries carry **oxygen-rich blood**, except the **pulmonary artery**, which carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.
* The **largest artery** is the **aorta**, which branches into smaller arteries and then into tiny arterioles.

**Key function:** Deliver oxygen and nutrients quickly to all organs.

---

### **2. Veins**

* Veins carry blood **back to the heart**.
* Their walls are **thin and less elastic** because the blood flows under **low pressure**.
* Veins have **special one-way doors (valves)** that prevent the blood from flowing backward (since pressure is low).
* Almost all veins carry **oxygen-poor blood**, except the **pulmonary vein**, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart.

**Key function:** Collect blood after it has delivered oxygen and nutrients, and return it to the heart.

---

### **3. Capillaries**

* Capillaries are the **smallest and thinnest blood vessels**, found everywhere in the body.
* Their walls are made of a **single layer of cells**, making them very thin.
* They form a network between the **arteries and veins**.
* Because of their thin walls, **exchange of materials** happens here:
  * Oxygen and nutrients pass from blood to body cells.
  * Carbon dioxide and wastes move from body cells into the blood.

* After the exchange, capillaries join together to form small veins called venules.

**Key function:** Allow the exchange of gases, food, and wastes between blood and body cells.

---

## **Blood Pressure**

Blood pressure is the **force with which blood pushes against the walls of the arteries** as the heart pumps it around the body. It tells us **how hard the heart is working** and how freely blood is flowing in the vessels.

---

### **How it is measured**

  * Blood pressure is measured using a device called a **sphygmomanometer** (the cuff that doctors wrap around the arm).
  * The reading is given in **millimeters of mercury (mmHg)**.
  * It has **two numbers**:

    1. **Systolic pressure (upper number)**

      * Pressure when the heart **contracts (beats)** and pushes blood out into the arteries.
      * Normal value: about **120 mmHg**.

    2. **Diastolic pressure (lower number)**

      * Pressure when the heart is **relaxed** between beats.
      * Normal value: about **80 mmHg**.

So, a normal reading is written as **120/80 mmHg**.

---

### **Types of Blood Pressure Problems**

  1. **High blood pressure (Hypertension)**

    * Reading higher than normal (e.g., 140/90 mmHg or more).
    * Puts extra strain on the heart and arteries.
    * Long-term hypertension can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.

  2. **Low blood pressure (Hypotension)**

    * Reading lower than normal (e.g., 90/60 mmHg or less).
    * Can make a person feel weak, dizzy, or faint because not enough blood is reaching the brain and other organs.

---

### **Why blood pressure is important**

* Maintains a steady flow of blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all body parts.
* If too **high**, it damages arteries and the heart.
* If too **low**, organs do not get enough blood supply.

---

## **Disorders of Circulatory System**

1. **Anemia** – Low hemoglobin or RBC count.
2. **Leukemia** – Cancer of WBCs.
3. **Hemophilia** – Blood does not clot properly.
4. **Hypertension** – High blood pressure.
5. **Heart attack (Myocardial infarction)** – Blockage of blood supply to heart muscle.
6. **Stroke** – Blockage or bleeding in brain blood vessels.

---

## **How to Keep Circulatory System Healthy**

* Eat balanced diet (iron, vitamins, low fat).
* Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol.

---

## **Interesting Facts about Circulation**

* Heart beats \~100,000 times per day.
* The total length of blood vessels in body is \~100,000 km (enough to circle Earth twice!).
* An adult body has about **5–6 liters of blood**.
* RBCs travel entire body in less than **1 minute**.
* Blood is red due to iron-containing hemoglobin.

# **Section 8: Nervous System – The Body’s Control Center**

The **nervous system** is the **communication network** of the body. It allows us to sense the world, think, feel, move, and maintain balance in all body functions. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to respond to our environment.

Just like a computer has a CPU (central processing unit), circuits, and input-output devices, our body has:

* **Brain** – the control center.
* **Spinal cord** – the main communication highway.
* **Nerves** – cables carrying messages.
* **Sense organs** – input devices.

![nervous](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-14-nervous.jpg)

---

## **Functions of the Nervous System**

1. **Sensory Input** – Collects information from inside and outside the body (e.g., eyes, ears, skin).
2. **Processing & Integration** – Brain and spinal cord process information, decide what to do.
3. **Motor Output** – Sends commands to muscles and glands to act.
4. **Homeostasis Regulation** – Maintains balance in body functions like breathing, heartbeat, temperature.
5. **Mental Activities** – Thinking, memory, emotions, creativity, and problem-solving.

---

## **Parts of the Nervous System**

The nervous system has **two main divisions**:

### 1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**

  * Brain + Spinal cord.
  * Main processing and control unit.

### 2. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**

  * Nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
  * Connects CNS with the rest of the body.

---

## **The Central Nervous System **

### **The Brain**

The **brain** is the most important and complex organ in the body.

* Weight: about **1.3–1.4 kilograms** in adults.
* Contains **about 86 billion neurons (nerve cells)**.
* Protected by the **skull**, three membranes and a fluid called **cerebrospinal fluid** that cushions it from shocks.

---

### **The Spinal Cord**

  * A long, cylindrical bundle of nerves inside the backbone (vertebral column).
  * Extends from the brainstem to the lower back.
  * Functions:

    * Relays messages between brain and body.
    * Controls **reflex actions** – quick, automatic responses (e.g., pulling hand away from a hot surface).

---

## **The Peripheral Nervous System **

It connect to limbs and organs. It is divided into:

### 1. **Somatic Nervous System**

  * Controls **voluntary actions** like walking, writing, speaking.
  * Transmits signals from brain → muscles.

### 2. **Autonomic Nervous System**

  * Controls **involuntary actions** like heartbeat, digestion, sweating, breathing rate.
  * Divided into:

    * **Sympathetic system** – “fight or flight” (prepares body in danger: increases heartbeat, widens pupils).
    * **Parasympathetic system** – “rest and digest” (calms body: slows heartbeat, aids digestion).

---

![neuron](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-15-neuron.jpg)

--- 

## **Nerve Cells – Neurons**

The basic unit of the nervous system is the **neuron**.

### **Structure of a Neuron**
  1. **Cell body (soma)** – contains nucleus and organelles.
  2. **Dendrites** – branch-like structures that receive signals.
  3. **Axon** – long fiber that carries signals away from the cell body.
  4. **Axon terminals** – transmit signals to other neurons, muscles, or glands.

### **How Neurons Work**

* Neurons transmit signals as tiny **electrical impulses**.
* Communication happens across a small gap called a **synapse**, where chemicals called **neurotransmitters** carry the message.

In this way, billions of neurons form an amazing network inside our brain and body.

---

## **Disorders of the Nervous System**

1. **Epilepsy** – Sudden bursts of abnormal brain activity → seizures.
2. **Stroke** – Interruption of blood supply to brain.
3. **Paralysis** – Loss of movement due to nerve/spinal cord damage.
4. **Parkinson’s disease** – Causes tremors and stiffness.
5. **Alzheimer’s disease** – Affects memory and thinking.

---

## **Keeping the Nervous System Healthy**

* Eat brain-friendly food (nuts, fish, whole grains, fruits, vegetables).
* Sleep at least 7–8 hours to rest the brain.
* Avoid alcohol, smoking, and harmful drugs.
* Keep the mind active – solve puzzles, read, learn new skills.

---

## **Amazing Facts about the Nervous System**

* Nerve impulses travel up to **400 km/h** – faster than a car on a highway!
* The brain uses about **20% of body’s oxygen** though it weighs only 2% of body weight.
* When we learn new things, the brain forms new connections between neurons.
* The human brain can generate more ideas than there are atoms in the universe!
* The spinal cord is so well protected that it is surrounded by **33 vertebrae**.

---

# **Section 9: Excretory System – Removing Wastes from the Body**

Every living organism produces waste as part of its life processes. If waste is not removed, it can become toxic and harmful. The **excretory system** ensures that our body stays clean from unwanted and harmful substances.

---

## **Why is Excretion Important?**

1. **Removes harmful substances** like urea, uric acid, carbon dioxide, and excess salts.
2. **Maintains water balance** (osmoregulation).
3. **Regulates blood pressure and volume**.
4. **Keeps the chemical composition of blood stable** (homeostasis).
5. **Prevents poisoning** – without excretion, toxins would build up and damage organs.

---

![excretory](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-16-excretory.jpg)

---

## **Organs of the Human Excretory System**

The human excretory system is mainly concerned with **liquid waste** removal. The major organs include:

1. **Kidneys** – the main filtering units.
2. **Ureters** – tubes that carry urine from kidneys to bladder.
3. **Urinary bladder** – stores urine temporarily.
4. **Urethra** – releases urine outside the body.

Additionally, other organs also help in excretion:

* **Skin** – removes salts, water, and urea through sweat.
* **Lungs** – remove carbon dioxide and some water vapor.
* **Liver** – breaks down toxins, old red blood cells, and excess amino acids.

---

## **The Kidneys – Natural Filters**

The kidneys are the **most important excretory organs**.

* Shape: Bean-shaped.
* Size: About 10–12 cm long in adults (like a fist).
* Location: One on each side of the spine, below the rib cage.
* Number: Humans normally have **two kidneys**, but a person can survive with just one.

### **Functions of the Kidneys**

1. Filter blood and remove wastes like urea
2. Maintain balance of salts (sodium, potassium, calcium).
3. Control water level in body
4. Regulate blood pressure by controlling fluid levels.
5. Produce hormones ( which helps make red blood cells).

---

## **Other Organs that Help in Excretion**

###  1. **Lungs**

  * Excrete **carbon dioxide** and some **water vapor** when we breathe out.

###  2. **Skin**

  * Sweat glands remove water, salts, and small amounts of urea.
  * Also helps in **temperature regulation**.

###  3. **Liver**

  * Breaks down excess amino acids → forms **urea**.
  * Removes **old red blood cells** → produces bile pigments.
  * Detoxifies drugs, alcohol, and harmful substances.

---

## **Disorders of the Excretory System**

1. **Kidney Stones** – Crystals of calcium, uric acid, or salts block urine flow, causing severe pain.
2. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)** – Bacterial infection in bladder, urethra, or kidneys.
3. **Kidney Failure** – Kidneys lose ability to filter blood; may require dialysis or transplant.
4. **Diabetes-related kidney damage** – High blood sugar damages nephrons.

---

## **Dialysis – Artificial Cleaning of Blood**

When kidneys fail, doctors use a machine for **dialysis**.

* Blood is passed through a machine with a special filter.
* Wastes are removed, and clean blood is returned to the body.
* Dialysis must be repeated regularly to keep the patient alive.

In severe cases, a **kidney transplant** may be required.

---

## **Keeping the Excretory System Healthy**

* Drink plenty of water (6–8 glasses daily).
* Eat less salt and sugar.
* Avoid excessive junk food and carbonated drinks.
* Limit alcohol and smoking.

---

## **Amazing Facts about the Excretory System**

* Kidneys filter about **50 gallons of blood daily**, producing **1.5–2 liters of urine**.
* A single kidney has about **1 million nephrons**.
* The color of urine can tell about hydration – pale yellow = healthy, dark yellow = dehydration.
* Some desert animals (like kangaroo rats) hardly produce urine to conserve water.
* Sweat is mostly water (99%), but also contains salts and small amounts of waste.

---

# **Section 10: Endocrine System**

The **endocrine system** is the body’s **chemical messenger system**. Unlike the nervous system that uses electrical signals, the endocrine system uses **hormones**—special chemicals that travel through the blood to control different organs and functions.

---

## **Functions of the Endocrine System**

1. **Regulates growth and development** (height, bones, muscles, puberty).
2. **Controls metabolism** (how fast food is converted into energy).
3. **Balances body functions** like sleep, hunger, and body temperature.
4. **Controls reproduction** and sexual development.
5. **Manages stress responses** through hormones like adrenaline.
6. Works with the **nervous system** to maintain body balance (homeostasis).

---

## **What are Hormones?**

* Hormones are **chemical messengers** secreted by glands.
* They travel in the **bloodstream** to target organs.
* Very **powerful**—even a tiny amount can cause big changes.
* Example: Insulin lowers blood sugar levels.

---

## **Keeping the Endocrine System Healthy**

* Eat a **balanced diet** (especially iodine, calcium, proteins).
* Sleep on time (helps melatonin work properly).
* Manage stress (excess stress disturbs adrenal hormones).
* Exercise regularly (keeps insulin and other hormones balanced).
* Avoid too much junk food and sugar (prevents diabetes).

---

# **Section 11: Immune System – The Body’s Defense System**

The **immune system** is the body’s **army of defense** against harmful invaders like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Without it, even a small cold could become life-threatening.

It is a **complex network of organs, tissues, and cells** that work together to protect us from diseases.

---

## **Functions of the Immune System**

1. **Recognizes harmful invaders** (germs, toxins, cancer cells).
2. **Destroys pathogens** before they cause illness.
3. **Remembers past infections** (immunity) to fight them faster next time.
4. **Repairs tissues** and heals wounds.
5. **Protects against abnormal cells** (like cancer).

---

## **Types of Immunity**

### **1. Innate Immunity (Natural immunity)**

  * Present from birth.
  * First line of defense.
  * Non-specific (attacks any invader).
  * Examples:

    * **Skin** – prevents entry of germs.
    * **Mucus in nose** – traps dust and microbes.
    * **Stomach acid** – kills bacteria in food.
    * **White blood cells (phagocytes)** – eat harmful germs.

---

### **2. Adaptive Immunity (Acquired immunity)**

* Developed when we are exposed to diseases or through vaccination.
* Specific – attacks only the particular germ it recognizes.
* Has **memory cells** → faster defense next time.
* Example: If you had chickenpox once, your immune system remembers it and protects you from getting it again.

---

### **3. Passive Immunity**

  * Temporary immunity received from another source.
  * Example:

    * Babies get antibodies from mother’s milk.
    * Ready-made antibodies given in injections for quick protection (like snake anti-venom).

---

## **Main Organs and Parts of the Immune System**

### **1. Bone Marrow**

* Spongy tissue inside bones.
* Produces **white blood cells (WBCs)**, red blood cells, and platelets.
* WBCs are the main fighters of the immune system.

---

### **2. Thymus Gland**

* Located in the chest.
* Matures special WBCs called **T-lymphocytes (T-cells)**.
* T-cells help recognize and destroy infected cells.

---

### **3. Lymph Nodes**

* Small bean-shaped structures found in neck, armpits, and groin.
* Filter germs and activate immune cells.
* Swell up when you have an infection (like during throat infection).

---

### **4. Spleen**

* Located on the left side of the abdomen.
* Filters blood and removes old blood cells.
* Stores WBCs and helps fight bacteria.

---

### **5. Tonsils and Adenoids**

* Located in the throat.
* Trap germs entering through mouth and nose.

---

## **How the Immune System Works**

1. A germ enters the body (example: virus).
2. **Innate immunity** tries to block it (skin, mucus, stomach acid).
3. If it enters, **WBCs** recognize it as foreign.
4. **B-cells produce antibodies** (proteins that attack germs).
5. **T-cells destroy infected cells**.
6. Immune system **remembers** the germ for future protection.

---

## **Vaccination and Immunity**

* Vaccines are **weakened or dead germs** injected into the body.
* They **train the immune system** to recognize the germ without making us sick.
* Examples: Polio vaccine, Measles vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines.

---

## **Disorders of the Immune System**

1. **Allergies** – immune system reacts too strongly to harmless things (dust, pollen, peanuts).
2. **Asthma** – triggered by allergens, leading to breathing problems.
3. **Autoimmune diseases** – immune system attacks own body cells (example: Type 1 Diabetes, Rheumatoid arthritis).
4. **Immunodeficiency diseases** – weak immune system (example: HIV/AIDS).
5. **Cancer of immune cells** – leukemia, lymphoma.

---

## **How to Keep the Immune System Healthy**

* Eat a **balanced diet** with vitamins and minerals.
* Get enough **sleep** (immunity weakens if sleep-deprived).
* Wash hands regularly to avoid infections.
* Get **vaccinated** on time.
* Avoid too much junk food and sugar.

---

## **Amazing Facts about the Immune System**

* The human body has **over 1 trillion immune cells**!
* A cut in the skin activates WBCs within minutes.
* Fever is actually a defense—heat slows down germs.
* Bone marrow produces **millions of WBCs every day**.
* The immune system can recognize **millions of different germs**.
