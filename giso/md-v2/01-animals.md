# **Section 1: Introduction to Animals**

### 1.1 What Are Animals?

Animals are living organisms that belong to the biological kingdom **Animalia**. They are multicellular, meaning their bodies are made of many cells, and these cells are specialized to perform different functions. Unlike plants, animals **cannot make their own food** through photosynthesis. Instead, they depend on eating plants, other animals, or both for survival.

Animals are found in almost every corner of the Earth—on land, in water, in the air, deep underground, and even in extreme environments like deserts and icy polar regions. From the tiniest microscopic organisms like rotifers to the largest blue whale, animals display an amazing diversity in size, shape, behavior, and lifestyle.

### 1.2 General Characteristics of Animals

While animals are diverse, they share some key characteristics:

1. **Multicellular** – Made up of many cells working together.
2. **Heterotrophic** – Cannot make their own food; they depend on other organisms.
3. **Movement** – Most animals can move at some stage of their life.
4. **Specialized Tissues** – They have tissues like muscles, nerves, and organs.
5. **Reproduction** – Most animals reproduce sexually, though some reproduce asexually.
6. **Growth and Development** – They grow, change, and pass through life stages.
7. **Adaptability** – Animals adjust to their surroundings for survival.

### 1.3 Importance of Animals in Nature

Animals play a **vital role in maintaining balance in ecosystems**. Without animals, natural cycles would collapse. Some key roles include:

- **Pollination**: Insects like bees and butterflies help plants reproduce.
- **Seed Dispersal**: Birds and mammals spread seeds to new places.
- **Food Chains**: Animals form an essential link between plants (producers) and decomposers.
- **Maintaining Populations**: Predators prevent overpopulation of herbivores.
- **Decomposition**: Animals like worms and beetles help recycle nutrients back to the soil.

### 1.4 Importance of Animals to Humans

Humans and animals have lived together for thousands of years. Animals are important to us in many ways:

- **Food**: Meat, milk, eggs, and seafood.
- **Clothing**: Wool, silk, leather.
- **Work**: Horses, oxen, camels, and elephants are used for carrying loads and farming.
- **Companionship**: Dogs, cats, and other pets provide emotional support.
- **Medicine**: Some medicines are developed from animal products.
- **Science**: Animals help researchers understand biology and medicine.

### 1.5 Diversity of Animals

The diversity of animals is extraordinary. Scientists estimate that there are more than **8.7 million species of animals**, though only about **1.5 million have been described** so far. These range from simple sponges and jellyfish to complex mammals like humans. The sheer variety of animals makes them one of the most fascinating subjects in science.

### 1.6 Fun Facts about Animals

- The **blue whale** is the largest animal on Earth, growing up to 30 meters long.
- The **bee hummingbird** of Cuba is the smallest bird, only about 5 cm long.
- A cheetah can run up to **120 km/h**, making it the fastest land animal.
- Octopuses have **three hearts** and can change color to camouflage themselves.
- Some animals like turtles and crocodiles have existed since the time of dinosaurs.

---

# **Section 2: Classification of Animals**

### 2.1 Why Classify Animals?

The animal kingdom is incredibly diverse. Imagine trying to study millions of species without order—it would be chaotic! Scientists use **classification** to organize animals into groups based on shared characteristics. This makes it easier to study, compare, and understand them.

Classification helps us answer questions like:

- Which animals are closely related?
- How are they different from others?
- Why do some animals share similar body features?

In science, classification is based on **structure, body systems, reproduction, and evolutionary history**.

---

### 2.2 Major Division: Vertebrates vs. Invertebrates

Animals are first divided into two broad groups:

1. **Vertebrates** – Animals with a backbone or spinal column.

   - They have an internal skeleton (endoskeleton) made of bone or cartilage.
   - Examples: fish, frogs, birds, cats, humans.

2. **Invertebrates** – Animals without a backbone.

   - They make up about **95% of all animals** on Earth.
   - Examples: insects, spiders, snails, worms, jellyfish.

---

### 2.3 Vertebrates (Animals with Backbones)

Vertebrates are further divided into **five main classes**:

#### (a) Mammals

- Warm-blooded (maintain constant body temperature).
- Have hair or fur on their body.
- Most give birth to live young (exceptions: platypus and echidna lay eggs).
- Mothers feed young ones with milk produced by mammary glands.
- Examples: humans, lions, elephants, dolphins, bats.

**Interesting Fact:** Bats are the only mammals that can fly.

---

#### (b) Birds

- Warm-blooded animals with feathers.
- Most can fly, though some (like ostriches and penguins) cannot.
- Lay eggs with hard shells.
- Have beaks instead of teeth.
- Light bones to make flying easier.
- Examples: eagles, sparrows, peacocks, penguins.

**Interesting Fact:** The ostrich is the largest bird, while the bee hummingbird is the smallest.

---

#### (c) Reptiles

- Cold-blooded (body temperature changes with surroundings).
- Covered with dry, scaly skin.
- Most lay eggs with leathery shells.
- Breathe through lungs.
- Examples: snakes, lizards, crocodiles, turtles.

**Interesting Fact:** Crocodiles have survived almost unchanged for 200 million years!

---

#### (d) Amphibians

- Cold-blooded animals that live both on land and in water.
- Smooth, moist skin (no scales).
- Lay eggs in water; eggs have no hard shell.
- Young ones (like tadpoles) live in water and breathe with gills, but adults breathe with lungs and skin.
- Examples: frogs, toads, salamanders, newts.

**Interesting Fact:** Frogs can absorb water through their skin, so they don’t need to drink.

---

#### (e) Fish

- Cold-blooded animals that live in water.
- Breathe using gills.
- Have fins for swimming and scales covering their body.
- Lay eggs in water.
- Examples: sharks, goldfish, tuna, seahorses.

**Interesting Fact:** Seahorses are fish, and it is the **male** seahorse that carries the eggs until they hatch!

---

### 2.4 Invertebrates (Animals without Backbones)

Invertebrates are extremely diverse and divided into many groups:

#### (a) Insects

- The largest group of animals.
- Body divided into head, thorax, and abdomen.
- Have six legs and usually two pairs of wings.
- Go through metamorphosis (egg → larva → pupa → adult).
- Examples: butterflies, ants, bees, grasshoppers.

**Interesting Fact:** There are more species of beetles than any other group of animals.

---

#### (b) Arachnids

- Eight legs (unlike insects which have six).
- No wings or antennae.
- Examples: spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites.

**Interesting Fact:** Some spiders can spin silk five times stronger than steel of the same thickness.

---

#### (c) Mollusks

- Soft-bodied animals, many with shells.
- Examples: snails, octopuses, clams, squids.
- Octopuses are known for their intelligence.

**Interesting Fact:** The giant squid has the largest eyes in the animal kingdom.

---

#### (d) Crustaceans

- Mostly aquatic.
- Have a hard exoskeleton.
- Usually have more than 10 legs.
- Examples: crabs, lobsters, shrimps, barnacles.

---

#### (e) Worms

- Long, soft, tube-like bodies.
- No legs.
- Found in soil, water, and inside other organisms (parasitic).
- Examples: earthworms, tapeworms, leeches.

---

#### (f) Echinoderms

- Spiny-skinned marine animals.
- Radial body symmetry.
- Can regenerate lost parts.
- Examples: starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers.

---

#### (g) Cnidarians

- Simple aquatic animals.
- Have stinging cells for defense and catching food.
- Examples: jellyfish, corals, sea anemones.

# **Section 3: Body Systems in Animals**

Animals survive because their bodies have **different systems working together**. Each system has a special job—like digestion, breathing, movement, or reproduction. Even though animals may look very different, many of their body systems work in similar ways.

---

## **3.1 Digestive System**

### Function

The digestive system breaks down food into simpler forms (nutrients) that the body can use for energy, growth, and repair.

### How it works in higher animals (like mammals)

1. **Mouth** – Food is chewed and mixed with saliva.
2. **Esophagus** – Carries food to the stomach.
3. **Stomach** – Food is mixed with digestive juices.
4. **Small intestine** – Nutrients are absorbed into the blood.
5. **Large intestine** – Water is absorbed, and waste is formed.
6. **Anus** – Waste is removed from the body.

### Variations in different animals

- **Herbivores (cows, rabbits):** Have longer intestines to digest tough plant material. Cows even have a **four-chambered stomach**.
- **Carnivores (lions, tigers):** Have shorter digestive systems because meat is easier to digest.
- **Birds:** Have a **crop** (storage organ) and a **gizzard** (grinds food, since they have no teeth).
- **Insects:** Have a simple tube-like digestive system, sometimes with special chambers.

---

## **3.2 Circulatory System**

### Function

The circulatory system transports **oxygen, nutrients, and hormones** throughout the body and removes waste products like carbon dioxide.

### Types of Circulatory Systems

1. **Open Circulatory System**

   - Blood does not always stay inside blood vessels.
   - Found in insects, mollusks.
   - Example: In a grasshopper, blood bathes organs directly.

2. **Closed Circulatory System**

   - Blood always stays inside blood vessels.
   - Found in mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians.
   - More efficient and allows faster transport.

### Heart Differences in Animals

- **Fish:** 2 chambers (1 atrium + 1 ventricle).
- **Amphibians & reptiles:** 3 chambers.
- **Birds & mammals:** 4 chambers (separates oxygenated and deoxygenated blood completely).

---

## **3.3 Respiratory System**

### Function

The respiratory system is responsible for exchanging gases—taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide.

### Different breathing organs in animals

- **Mammals & birds:** Lungs.
- **Fish:** Gills.
- **Amphibians:** Gills as young (tadpoles), lungs + skin as adults.
- **Insects:** Tracheae (tiny air tubes that bring air directly to cells).
- **Earthworms:** Breathe through skin.

### Fun fact

Whales and dolphins are mammals, so they have lungs. They must come to the surface to breathe through their blowholes.

---

## **3.4 Nervous System**

### Function

Controls body functions, movement, senses, and responses to the environment.

### Parts of a Nervous System

1. **Brain** – Main control center.
2. **Spinal cord** – Connects brain to the rest of the body.
3. **Nerves** – Carry messages.

### Differences among animals

- **Simple animals (like sponges):** No brain or nerves.
- **Cnidarians (jellyfish):** Have a nerve net.
- **Insects:** Small brain + nerve cords.
- **Mammals:** Large, complex brain (especially humans).

### Senses

- Most animals have **5 senses** (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch).
- Some have extra senses:

  - Bats use **echolocation**.
  - Snakes detect heat with pit organs.
  - Sharks sense tiny electric fields in water.

---

## **3.5 Skeletal and Muscular System**

### Function

Provides shape, protection, and helps in movement.

### Types of Skeletons

1. **Endoskeleton (internal skeleton):** Found in vertebrates. Made of bones and cartilage.
2. **Exoskeleton (external skeleton):** Found in insects, crabs, etc. Provides protection but must be shed for growth (molting).
3. **Hydrostatic skeleton:** Found in soft-bodied animals like earthworms, jellyfish—fluid inside body gives shape.

### Muscles

- Work with the skeleton for movement.
- Different muscle types:

  - Skeletal muscles (voluntary).
  - Smooth muscles (involuntary, e.g., stomach walls).
  - Cardiac muscles (heart, involuntary but very strong).

---

## **3.6 Excretory System**

### Function

Removes waste products like urea, carbon dioxide, and excess water.

### Different Excretory Organs

- **Mammals:** Kidneys filter blood to form urine.
- **Insects:** Have Malpighian tubules.
- **Earthworms:** Have nephridia.
- **Fish:** Kidneys remove waste into water.

---

## **3.7 Reproductive System**

### Function

Enables animals to produce offspring and continue their species.

### Two Types of Reproduction

1. **Sexual Reproduction**

   - Involves male and female gametes (sperm and egg).
   - Offspring are similar to parents but not identical.
   - Examples: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish.

2. **Asexual Reproduction**

   - Only one parent needed.
   - Offspring are exact copies (clones).
   - Found in simple animals like sponges, hydra, starfish (regeneration).

### Special Cases

- **Oviparous animals:** Lay eggs (birds, reptiles, amphibians).
- **Viviparous animals:** Give birth to live young (mammals).
- **Ovoviviparous animals:** Eggs hatch inside the mother’s body (sharks, some snakes).

---

## **3.8 Immune System**

### Function

Protects animals from diseases and harmful germs.

- **Invertebrates:** Rely mainly on general defenses (like barriers or simple immune cells).
- **Vertebrates:** Have complex immune systems with antibodies.

Example: When a human gets a vaccine, the immune system learns how to fight a disease in the future.

---

## **3.9 Endocrine System**

### Function

Controls body activities using **hormones** (chemical messengers).

Examples of hormones:

- **Insulin:** Controls sugar level.
- **Adrenaline:** Prepares body for "fight or flight."
- **Growth hormone:** Helps in body growth.

Even simple animals use chemical signals to control body functions.

---

## **3.10 Body Systems Working Together**

No system works alone. For example:

- When you run, your **muscles** move, your **respiratory system** brings in oxygen, your **circulatory system** delivers it, and your **nervous system** controls the coordination.

This teamwork keeps animals alive and active.

---

# **Section 4: Animal Habitats and Adaptations**

Animals live all around the world—in deserts, oceans, mountains, forests, polar regions, and even inside other organisms. Each environment has unique challenges, and animals have developed **adaptations** to survive there.

An **adaptation** is a special feature or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. Adaptations can be:

- **Structural** (body features, e.g., thick fur).
- **Behavioral** (actions, e.g., migration).
- **Physiological** (internal functions, e.g., hibernation, producing venom).

Let’s study habitats one by one.

---

## **4.1 Terrestrial Habitats (Land)**

---

## **4.7 Human Impact on Habitats**

Sadly, many habitats are being destroyed because of human activities:

- **Deforestation:** Destroys forest homes.
- **Pollution:** Affects rivers, oceans, and air.
- **Global warming:** Melts polar ice caps, endangering polar bears and penguins.
- **Poaching and hunting:** Reduce animal populations.

**Conservation efforts:**

- National parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
- Breeding programs for endangered species.
- Bans on hunting certain animals.
- Teaching people about protecting nature.

---

# **Section 5: Animal Behavior and Communication**

Animals don’t just live in isolation. They interact with each other, with their environment, and sometimes even with humans. These interactions are guided by **behavior** and **communication**.

---

## **5.1 What is Animal Behavior?**

**Behavior** is the way an animal acts in response to its environment, other animals, or internal needs (like hunger or safety).
It includes:

- Searching for food.
- Protecting themselves from predators.
- Finding mates.
- Caring for young ones.
- Building shelters or nests.

**Types of behaviors:**

1. **Innate behavior** – Inborn, instinctive actions. Example: Spiders spinning webs, turtles heading to sea after hatching.
2. **Learned behavior** – Developed through experience. Example: A dog learning tricks, birds recognizing danger.
3. **Social behavior** – Actions in groups. Example: Ants working together, wolves hunting in packs.

---

## **5.2 Communication in Animals**

Communication means **sending and receiving information**. Animals use various methods:

### A. **Sound Communication**

- **Birdsong:** Used to attract mates or mark territory.
- **Whale songs:** Travel long distances under the ocean.
- **Dogs:** Bark, growl, or whimper to show emotions.
- **Elephants:** Use deep sounds (infrasound) that travel kilometers.

### B. **Visual Communication**

- **Peacock’s dance:** Shows off colorful feathers to attract a mate.
- **Fireflies:** Flash light signals at night.
- **Chameleons:** Change colors to warn or blend.
- **Honeybees:** Perform “waggle dance” to show location of food.

### C. **Chemical Communication**

Animals release **pheromones** (special chemicals) to send messages.

- **Ants:** Leave trails for other ants to follow.
- **Moths:** Release scents to attract mates.
- **Dogs and cats:** Mark territory with urine smell.

### D. **Touch Communication**

- **Monkeys:** Groom each other to show friendship.
- **Elephants:** Wrap trunks around each other in greeting.
- **Cats:** Rub against humans to show affection and claim territory.

---

## **5.3 Survival Behaviors**

### A. Finding Food (Foraging)

- **Lions:** Hunt in groups to catch big prey.
- **Bees:** Collect nectar and inform others with a waggle dance.
- **Woodpeckers:** Drill trees to find insects.

### B. Protecting from Predators

- **Camouflage:** Stick insects look like twigs.
- **Mimicry:** Harmless butterfly resembles poisonous one.
- **Warning colors:** Frogs and snakes with bright skin warn they are poisonous.
- **Herding:** Zebras move in groups so predators get confused.

### C. Reproductive Behavior

- **Courtship dances:** Birds of paradise perform elaborate dances.
- **Songs:** Male frogs croak loudly to attract females.
- **Nest building:** Birds and fish prepare safe spots for eggs.

---

## **5.4 Social Behavior in Animals**

Some animals live in groups and develop **social systems**.

- **Insects (ants, bees, termites):** Have colonies with specialized roles (queen, workers, soldiers).
- **Wolves:** Live in packs with an alpha leader.
- **Dolphins:** Hunt and play together, showing strong bonds.
- **Elephants:** Herds are led by the oldest female (matriarch).

Benefits of group living:

- Safety from predators.
- Easier to hunt food.
- Better care for young ones.
- Learning from each other.

---

## **5.5 Intelligence in Animals**

Scientists now know that many animals show signs of **intelligence and problem-solving**.

- **Chimpanzees:** Use sticks to get termites from holes.
- **Crows:** Bend wires into hooks to pick food.
- **Octopuses:** Open jars and solve puzzles.
- **Dolphins:** Use bubbles and teamwork to trap fish.
- **Elephants:** Recognize themselves in mirrors.

---

## **5.6 Special Animal Behaviors**

- **Hibernation:** Deep sleep in winter to save energy. Example: Bears, hedgehogs.
- **Estivation:** Rest during extreme heat or drought. Example: Desert snails, lungfish.
- **Tool use:** Animals like otters use stones to break shells.

---

## **5.7 Human-Animal Communication**

Humans have learned to communicate with animals in limited ways:

- **Dogs and cats:** Understand human tone and gestures.
- **Parrots:** Can mimic human speech.
- **Dolphins:** Respond to whistles and symbols.
- **Horses:** Respond to commands and body language.

This shows that the bond between humans and animals is strong and evolving.

---

## **5.8 Why Studying Animal Behavior is Important**

- Helps in **wildlife conservation** by understanding needs of species.
- Helps farmers manage livestock better.
- Improves human-animal relationships (pets, working animals).
- Helps scientists learn about evolution of intelligence.

---

# **Section 6: Animals and Their Role in Ecosystems**

An **ecosystem** is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria) interacting with their **non-living environment** (air, water, soil, climate).

Animals play **crucial roles** in ecosystems, ensuring that energy flows, nutrients cycle, and balance is maintained. Without animals, most ecosystems would collapse.

---

## **6.1 Food Chains and Food Webs**

### **Food Chain**

A **food chain** is a sequence showing how energy passes from one organism to another.

- Example: **Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Eagle**
  Here:
- Grass = Producer (makes its own food via photosynthesis).
- Grasshopper = Primary consumer (herbivore).
- Frog = Secondary consumer (carnivore).
- Snake = Tertiary consumer.
- Eagle = Apex predator (top of chain).

### **Food Web**

In reality, animals eat more than one type of food. A **food web** is a network of interconnected food chains.

- Example: In a forest, deer eat grass, rabbits eat plants, owls eat rabbits, tigers eat deer, and vultures eat dead animals.

Food webs show **interdependence**—if one species disappears, the balance is disturbed.

---

## **6.2 Trophic Levels**

Animals occupy different levels in a food chain:

1. **Producers (plants, algae):** Not animals, but the base.
2. **Primary consumers (herbivores):** Cows, rabbits, elephants.
3. **Secondary consumers (carnivores):** Frogs, snakes.
4. **Tertiary consumers (top carnivores):** Tigers, sharks.
5. **Decomposers (fungi, bacteria, scavengers):** Break down dead matter.

**Energy transfer rule:** Only about **10% of energy** passes from one level to the next. That’s why food chains are short—too many levels would run out of energy.

---

## **6.3 Role of Herbivores**

Herbivores eat plants and are the **link between plants and carnivores**.

- **Examples:** Deer, cows, giraffes, elephants, caterpillars.
- Roles:

  - Control plant population.
  - Spread seeds through droppings.
  - Provide food for carnivores.

Without herbivores, plants would overgrow and carnivores would starve.

---

## **6.4 Role of Carnivores**

Carnivores control herbivore numbers and keep ecosystems balanced.

- **Examples:** Lions, wolves, tigers, snakes, eagles.
- Roles:

  - Prevent herbivores from overgrazing.
  - Remove weak or sick animals (natural selection).
  - Maintain diversity by stopping any one species from dominating.

If carnivores vanish, herbivores multiply uncontrollably and destroy vegetation, leading to famine for all.

---

## **6.5 Role of Omnivores**

Omnivores eat both plants and animals, making them **flexible survivors**.

- **Examples:** Bears, pigs, crows, humans.
- Roles:

  - Balance food webs by feeding on multiple sources.
  - Control both plant and animal populations.
  - Act as scavengers (clean up dead matter).

---

## **6.6 Role of Scavengers**

Scavengers eat **dead animals** (carrion). They act as **nature’s cleanup crew**.

- **Examples:** Vultures, hyenas, jackals, crabs.
- Importance:

  - Prevent spread of disease by disposing of carcasses.
  - Recycle nutrients back into the soil.
  - Support decomposers by breaking big carcasses into smaller pieces.

---

## **6.7 Role of Decomposers**

Decomposers are not animals (fungi, bacteria), but animals like **earthworms, dung beetles, and millipedes** help in decomposition.

- **Earthworms:** Mix soil and improve fertility (“farmer’s friend”).
- **Dung beetles:** Roll animal waste into balls and bury it, enriching soil.
- **Millipedes & termites:** Break down dead plants and wood.

They return nutrients to the soil, allowing plants to grow again.

---

## **6.8 Pollinators**

Some animals are **pollinators**—they help plants reproduce by transferring pollen.

- **Examples:** Bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, bats.
- Importance:

  - 75% of flowering plants depend on pollinators.
  - Without them, humans would lose fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
  - Bees are the most important pollinators in agriculture.

---

## **6.9 Seed Dispersers**

Animals also spread seeds to new places.

- **Birds:** Eat fruits and drop seeds in droppings.
- **Monkeys:** Carry fruits and throw seeds away.
- **Elephants:** Digest fruits and spread seeds over large distances.
- **Squirrels:** Hide nuts and forget them—these grow into trees.

This prevents overcrowding of plants and helps forests grow.

---

## **6.10 Engineers of Ecosystems**

Some animals change the environment in ways that benefit other species.

- **Beavers:** Build dams, creating ponds for fish and birds.
- **Elephants:** Knock down trees, opening space for grasslands.
- **Termites:** Build mounds that improve soil aeration.
- **Coral polyps:** Build coral reefs, providing homes for thousands of marine species.

These are called **keystone species**—their presence supports entire ecosystems.

---

## **6.11 Balance in Nature**

Animals keep ecosystems balanced. If one group disappears:

- No herbivores → Carnivores starve.
- No carnivores → Herbivores overeat plants.
- No pollinators → Plants fail to reproduce.
- No decomposers → Dead matter piles up, soil becomes infertile.

Each animal, no matter how small, plays a role in maintaining the **circle of life**.

---

## **6.12 Case Studies**

- **Wolves in Yellowstone Park (USA):** When wolves were reintroduced, they controlled deer populations. This allowed trees to grow, which attracted birds and beavers, which changed rivers. One predator restored the entire ecosystem!
- **Bees in Farming:** Without bees, crops like apples, almonds, and coffee cannot grow.
- **Vultures in India:** Decline in vultures led to rotting carcasses, spreading disease to humans and increasing stray dog populations.

# **Section 7: Animals and Humans**

Humans and animals have shared the Earth for millions of years. Our relationship with animals is **deep, complex, and constantly evolving**. Humans depend on animals for food, work, companionship, and cultural traditions. At the same time, human activities strongly affect animal populations and habitats.

In this section, we will explore the **different ways humans and animals interact**—from domestication and farming to pets, working animals, and cultural importance.

---

## **7.1 Domestication of Animals**

**Domestication** is the process by which humans tame wild animals and breed them over generations for specific purposes.

- First domesticated animal: **Dogs** (around 15,000–30,000 years ago).
- Other important domestic animals: Cats, cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, chickens.

Domestication provided humans with:

- **Food** (milk, eggs, meat).
- **Work** (horses, oxen, donkeys).
- **Protection** (dogs as guards).
- **Companionship** (cats, dogs).

Domesticated animals are different from wild animals because they depend on humans for survival.
