# üìò Food, Health, and Disease

Health is the most precious wealth a person can have. A strong and healthy body enables us to study, play, work, and enjoy life. Without good health, even the richest treasures become meaningless. To maintain health, food plays the most important role. Food is not only the fuel for our body but also a source of nutrients that build and repair tissues, protect us from diseases, and give us energy to function daily.

Along with food, maintaining cleanliness, adopting good hygiene practices, exercising regularly, and protecting ourselves from harmful germs are equally important. On the other hand, ignorance of health rules, consumption of junk food, and exposure to infections can lead to diseases.

In this detailed course, we will explore **food, nutrients, balanced diet, hygiene, diseases, immunity, and healthy living** in a way that prepares students for Olympiad-level understanding.

## **2. Food: The Fuel of Life**

Every living being, from a tiny ant to a mighty elephant, needs food. Without food, life cannot continue. Unlike machines that run on petrol or electricity, the human body runs on food.

Food is defined as any substance that is eaten, drunk, or absorbed to provide energy, promote growth, maintain body functions, and protect against diseases. It contains essential nutrients, water, and roughage that are necessary for survival.

### Why Do We Need Food?

1. **Energy** ‚Äì All activities like running, walking, breathing, and even thinking require energy.
2. **Growth** ‚Äì Children grow taller, stronger, and heavier because food provides building materials for the body.
3. **Repair** ‚Äì If we fall or get injured, food helps repair damaged tissues.
4. **Protection** ‚Äì Certain nutrients in food make the body strong against diseases.
5. **Regulation** ‚Äì Food helps in proper functioning of body organs like the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, and digestive system.

Without food, survival is impossible. Scientists say that humans can live for weeks without food, but the body will become weak, lose immunity, and eventually stop functioning.

## **3. Types of Nutrients**

Food contains different chemical substances called **nutrients**. Each nutrient plays a specific role. Together, they keep the body healthy. The main nutrients are **carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and roughage.**

---

### **A. Carbohydrates**

* Known as **energy-giving foods**.
* Provide immediate energy to perform activities.
* Examples: rice, wheat, maize, sugar, bread, potatoes.

**Types of Carbohydrates:**

1. **Simple carbohydrates** ‚Äì Sugar, honey, sweets. Quickly digested and give instant energy but not long-lasting.
2. **Complex carbohydrates** ‚Äì Rice, chapati, oats, corn. Digested slowly and provide steady energy.

**Importance:**

* Athletes eat carbohydrate-rich meals before competitions for stamina.
* Lack of carbohydrates causes weakness and tiredness.

---

### **B. Proteins**

* Called **body-building foods**.
* Essential for growth and repair of tissues.
* Sources: milk, eggs, pulses, beans, cheese, fish, meat.

**Importance:**

* Children need more protein as they are growing.
