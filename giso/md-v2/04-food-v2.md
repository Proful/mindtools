# Food, Health, and Disease

---

### Why Do We Need Food?

1. **Energy** – All activities like running, walking, breathing, and even thinking require energy.
2. **Growth** – Children grow taller, stronger, and heavier because food provides building materials for the body.
3. **Repair** – If we fall or get injured, food helps repair damaged tissues.
4. **Protection** – Certain nutrients in food make the body strong against diseases.
5. **Regulation** – Food helps in proper functioning of body organs like the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, and digestive system.

## **3. Types of Nutrients**

Food contains different chemical substances called **nutrients**. Each nutrient plays a specific role. Together, they keep the body healthy. The main nutrients are **carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and roughage.**

---

### **A. Carbohydrates**

* Known as **energy-giving foods**.
* Provide immediate energy to perform activities.
* Examples: rice, wheat, maize, sugar, bread, potatoes.

**Types of Carbohydrates:**

1. **Simple carbohydrates** – Sugar, honey, sweets. Quickly digested and give instant energy but not long-lasting.
2. **Complex carbohydrates** – Rice, chapati, oats, corn. Digested slowly and provide steady energy.

**Importance:**

* Athletes eat carbohydrate-rich meals before competitions for stamina.
* Lack of carbohydrates causes weakness and tiredness.

---

### **B. Proteins**

* Called **body-building foods**.
* Essential for growth and repair of tissues.
* Sources: milk, eggs, pulses, beans, cheese, fish, meat.

**Importance:**

* Children need more protein as they are growing.
* Deficiency leads to stunted growth and weak immunity.

---

### **C. Fats**

* Also provide energy but are stored in the body.
* Keep the body warm and act as energy reserves.
* Sources: butter, ghee, nuts, seeds, oils, cream.

**Good Fats vs. Bad Fats:**

* **Good fats**: found in nuts, olive oil, fish.
* **Bad fats**: excessive fried food and junk food cause obesity and heart diseases.

---

### **D. Vitamins**

* Needed in small amounts but very important.
* Called **protective foods** because they keep us safe from diseases.

**Types and Functions:**

### 1. **Vitamin A**

  * **Functions**:
    * Keeps our eyes healthy (helps us see in dim light).
    * Maintains smooth and glowing skin.
    * Helps in proper growth and development.

  * **Sources**: Carrots, papaya, mango, spinach, milk, fish liver oil.

  * **Deficiency Disease**:
    * **Night blindness** → person cannot see properly in dim light.

    * Keeps the brain and nerves working properly.
    * Important for healthy red blood cells.

  * **Sources**: Whole grains, milk, eggs, meat, pulses, nuts.

  * **Deficiency Disease**:
    * **Beri-Beri** (lack of Vitamin B1) → causes weakness, tiredness, pain in muscles.
    * **Pellagra** (lack of Vitamin B3) → skin problems, diarrhea, memory loss.
    * **Anaemia** (lack of Vitamin B12) → body feels weak due to fewer red blood cells.

  * **Extra Tip**: Vitamin B is a group, not just one vitamin (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 etc.).

---

### 3. **Vitamin C**

  * **Functions**:
    * Helps wounds heal quickly.
    * Protects the body from infections (boosts immunity).
    * Keeps gums and teeth healthy.

  * **Sources**: Lemon, orange, guava, amla (Indian gooseberry), tomatoes, green chili.

---

### **G. Roughage (Dietary Fiber)**

* Indigestible part of food.
* Found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
* Prevents constipation and helps in digestion.

---

## **6. Balanced Diet & Food Pyramid**

A **balanced diet** is one that contains all the nutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, roughage, and water—in the right amounts. Eating only one type of food will not keep us healthy. For example, eating only rice will give energy but no vitamins; eating only fruits will give vitamins but less energy.

### **The Food Pyramid**

The food pyramid is a simple visual guide to show how much of each food group should be eaten daily.

**Levels of the Food Pyramid:**

1. **Base (Bottom Layer)** – Energy-giving foods like cereals, rice, wheat, bread, potatoes.
2. **Second Layer** – Vegetables and fruits (rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber).
3. **Third Layer** – Milk, eggs, fish, pulses, meat (rich in proteins and calcium).
4. **Top Layer** – Oils, fats, butter, sugar (should be eaten sparingly).

## **7. Cooking, Preservation & Food Safety**

### **Cooking of Food**

Cooking makes food soft, tasty, and digestible. It also kills harmful microorganisms.

**Common Methods of Cooking:**

* **Boiling** – Cooking rice, eggs, and pulses in water.
* **Steaming** – Cooking idlis, vegetables; it preserves nutrients.
* **Roasting** – Cooking chapatis, peanuts; requires less oil.
* **Frying** – Cooking puris, pakoras; tasty but not very healthy if eaten often.
* **Baking** – Cooking cakes, bread, and biscuits in an oven.

**Nutrient Loss in Cooking:**

* Overcooking vegetables destroys vitamins.
* Washing vegetables after cutting leads to loss of water-soluble vitamins like Vitamin C and B.
* Using excess oil increases unhealthy fats.

---

### **Food Preservation**

Food spoils due to microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and molds. Spoiled food smells bad and may cause diseases. Preservation prevents spoilage.

**Methods of Food Preservation:**

1. **Refrigeration/Freezing** – Slows down microbial growth.
2. **Drying** – Removing water prevents germ growth (papad, dried fish).
3. **Pickling** – Preserves food in salt, oil, or vinegar.
4. **Canning/Bottling** – Food is sealed in airtight containers.
5. **Salting/Sugaring** – High salt or sugar concentration prevents microbial activity.
6. **Pasteurization** – Milk is heated and cooled to kill germs.

---

## **8. Water and Its Importance in Health**

### **Functions of Water**

1. Maintains body temperature.
2. Helps in digestion and absorption of food.
3. Removes waste products through urine and sweat.
4. Transports nutrients and oxygen in the blood.
5. Prevents dehydration.

### **Daily Requirement**

* Adults: 2–3 liters per day.
* Children: At least 1.5 liters per day.

---

## **9. Deficiency Diseases**

Deficiency diseases occur when the body does not get enough of a particular nutrient for a long time. These diseases weaken the body and may affect growth.

## **14. Germs and Modes of Transmission**

### **What are Germs?**

Germs are microscopic organisms that can cause diseases. The four main types of germs are:

1. **Bacteria** – Tiny organisms that can be harmful (e.g., TB, cholera) or useful (e.g., making curd).
2. **Viruses** – Smaller than bacteria; cause diseases like flu, measles, polio, COVID-19.
3. **Protozoa** – Single-celled organisms; cause malaria, amoebiasis.
4. **Fungi** – Cause skin infections like ringworm.

### **Modes of Transmission**

1. **Through Air** – Sneezing, coughing release droplets (e.g., common cold, flu).
2. **Through Water** – Contaminated water spreads cholera, typhoid.
3. **Through Food** – Spoiled or unhygienic food spreads food poisoning.
4. **Through Direct Contact** – Touching infected persons spreads chickenpox, ringworm.
5. **Through Insects (Vectors)** – Mosquitoes spread malaria, dengue; houseflies spread dysentery.
6. **Through Animals** – Rabies spreads through dog bites.

### **Breaking the Chain of Transmission**

* Use masks and handkerchiefs.
* Boil or filter water before drinking.
* Wash hands with soap.
* Use insect repellents and mosquito nets.
* Vaccinate pets and avoid stray animal bites.

## **15. Immunity and Vaccination**

### **What is Immunity?**

Immunity is the body’s **defense system** against germs and diseases. A person with strong immunity does not fall sick easily.

**Types of Immunity:**

  1. **Natural Immunity** – Present from birth (e.g., skin, tears, stomach acid act as barriers).
  2. **Acquired Immunity** – Developed after infection or vaccination.
    * Example: After recovering from chickenpox, the body produces antibodies that prevent future infections.

---

### **Vaccination**

Vaccination is the process of giving vaccines to protect against diseases. A **vaccine** is a substance that stimulates the body to produce **antibodies** without causing the actual disease.

**Common Vaccines for Children:**

* **BCG** – Tuberculosis
* **DPT** – Diphtheria, Pertussis (Whooping Cough), Tetanus
* **Polio Vaccine** – Prevents polio
* **MMR** – Measles, Mumps, Rubella
* **Hepatitis B Vaccine**
* **COVID-19 Vaccine** (for older children and adults)

### **Importance of Vaccination**

* Prevents deadly diseases.
* Protects not only the vaccinated person but also the community (herd immunity).
* Saves money by reducing hospital visits.
* Helps in eradication of diseases (e.g., polio nearly eradicated worldwide).
