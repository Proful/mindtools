##  Section 1: Introduction to Plants

---

###  What Are Plants?

Plants are **living organisms** that belong to the kingdom **Plantae**. They are found almost everywhere on Earth — in deserts, mountains, forests, oceans, and even in extreme conditions like polar regions. Unlike animals, plants **make their own food** using a special process called **photosynthesis**.

Scientists estimate that there are about **390,000 species of plants** in the world, and nearly **30,000 of them are used by humans** for food, medicine, building materials, and other purposes.

Plants are **autotrophs**, meaning they can produce their own food. Most plants are green because they contain **chlorophyll**, a pigment that helps them capture sunlight.

---

###  Characteristics of Plants

Plants share some key characteristics that make them different from animals, fungi, or bacteria:

1. **They are multicellular.**

   - Plants are made of many cells that work together.
   - Their cells have a special structure called a **cell wall** made of cellulose, which gives them strength.

2. **They make their own food.**

   - Through **photosynthesis**, plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen.

3. **They are non-motile.**

   - Most plants cannot move from place to place like animals.
   - However, they show movements like opening flowers, bending towards light, or closing leaves when touched (e.g., _Mimosa pudica_).

4. **They grow throughout life.**

   - Unlike animals, many plants keep growing taller or wider throughout their lifespan.

5. **They reproduce.**

   - Plants reproduce by seeds, spores, or vegetative parts like stems and roots.

---

###  The Science of Botany

The study of plants is called **Botany**. It is one of the oldest sciences, as humans have always depended on plants for food and medicine. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Indians studied plants for healing and agriculture.

Today, botany includes modern branches such as:

- **Plant Physiology** (how plants work internally)
- **Plant Ecology** (interaction with the environment)
- **Plant Genetics** (study of heredity and variation in plants)
- **Plant Pathology** (study of plant diseases)

---

###  Diversity of Plants

Plants come in all shapes and sizes:

- **Tiny plants** like algae or mosses, which grow in moist areas
- **Flowering plants** like roses, sunflowers, and mango trees
- **Tallest plants** like redwood trees, which can grow over 100 meters
- **Unique plants** like cactus that survive in deserts or lotus that floats on water

This diversity makes plants one of the most fascinating groups of living organisms.

---

###  Plants as the Foundation of Life

Every living organism depends on plants directly or indirectly:

- **Herbivores** eat plants
- **Carnivores** eat herbivores (which ate plants first)
- **Humans** eat plants and animals but still rely on plants for oxygen, food, and materials

Thus, plants are at the **base of the food chain** and are called **primary producers**. Without them, life on Earth would not exist.

---

### ️ Historical Importance of Plants

Since ancient times, plants have shaped human civilization:

- Early humans collected wild fruits, nuts, and tubers from plants.
- The discovery of **agriculture (around 10,000 years ago)** allowed humans to settle in one place instead of wandering.
- Plants like wheat, rice, and maize became staple foods for entire civilizations.
- Ancient Indian texts like the _Ayurveda_ described hundreds of medicinal plants.

Even today, many life-saving drugs (like aspirin, quinine, morphine) come from plants.

---

###  Observing Plants Around Us

Students preparing for Science Olympiad should not just memorize facts but also **observe plants around them**. For example:

- Notice how grass has fine roots (fibrous system) while carrot has one main root (tap root).
- See how a sunflower turns its head towards sunlight (heliotropism).
- Compare the large floating leaves of lotus with needle-shaped leaves of pine trees.

Observation is the best way to learn science.

---

###  Mini Experiment: Do Plants Breathe?

**Aim:** To show that plants release oxygen during photosynthesis.

**Materials:**

- A water-filled glass jar
- A small aquatic plant (e.g., hydrilla or elodea)
- A funnel and a test tube

**Steps:**

1. Place the plant in the jar under the funnel.
2. Invert the test tube filled with water over the funnel’s stem.
3. Keep the jar in sunlight for a few hours.

**Observation:** Bubbles of oxygen collect in the test tube.

**Conclusion:** Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis.

---

###  Summary of Section 1

- Plants are **living organisms** that produce their own food.
- They are **essential for life** on Earth, forming the base of the food chain.
- Botany is the scientific study of plants.
- Plants are **diverse** in form and function, ranging from tiny mosses to giant trees.
- Ancient civilizations heavily relied on plants for food, shelter, and medicine.
- Observation and simple experiments can help us understand plant life better.

---

#  Section 2: Importance of Plants in Our Lives and the Environment

---

Plants are not just silent, green organisms that stand in our gardens or forests. They are **vital for survival** — every breath of oxygen we take, every grain of rice we eat, every medicine we consume, and even the wooden furniture in our homes, comes from plants. This section explores the **many ways plants are important for humans, animals, and the Earth itself**.

---

## ️ 2.1 Plants and Oxygen – The Breath of Life

The most important role of plants is that they **produce oxygen** through **photosynthesis**. Humans and animals need oxygen for respiration (to release energy from food).

- Without plants, oxygen levels in the atmosphere would drop, making life impossible.
- Forests and oceans together contribute most of the oxygen on Earth.
- The **Amazon rainforest** is called the _“Lungs of the Earth”_ because it produces about **20% of the world’s oxygen**.

 **Olympiad Tip:** Be prepared for questions like: _“Which rainforest is called the Lungs of the Earth?”_ or _“What gas do plants give out during photosynthesis?”_

---

##  2.2 Plants as Food Sources

Plants form the **basis of the food chain**. They are the only organisms that can prepare their own food, which is then eaten by herbivores, omnivores, and even indirectly by carnivores.

###  Plants We Eat

1. **Cereals and grains:** Rice, wheat, maize, barley – staple food for billions.
2. **Fruits:** Mango, banana, apple, grapes – provide vitamins and minerals.
3. **Vegetables:** Spinach, carrot, potato, tomato – rich in nutrients and fiber.
4. **Pulses and legumes:** Lentils, beans, peas – rich in proteins.
5. **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, cashew, sunflower seeds – contain healthy fats.

###  Special Notes

- Different parts of plants serve as food:

  - Roots (carrot, beetroot)
  - Stems (sugarcane, potato)
  - Leaves (spinach, lettuce)
  - Flowers (broccoli, cauliflower)
  - Fruits (mango, papaya)
  - Seeds (wheat, rice, groundnut)

---

##  2.3 Plants as Shelter and Habitat

Plants provide **shelter** to countless organisms:

- **Birds** build nests on trees.
- **Insects** like ants, bees, and beetles live inside plants.
- **Large animals** like monkeys and squirrels live on trees.
- **Humans** use wood, bamboo, and palm leaves to build houses.

Forests are called **“homes of biodiversity”** because millions of species depend on them.

---

##  2.4 Plants in Medicine

Since ancient times, plants have been used as natural healers.

- **Tulsi (Holy Basil):** Used for cough and cold.
- **Neem:** Known for antibacterial properties.
- **Aloe vera:** Heals wounds and burns.
- **Turmeric:** Powerful anti-inflammatory spice.
- **Cinchona tree:** Source of quinine, used to treat malaria.
- **Willow tree:** Source of salicylic acid, used to make aspirin.

 **Olympiad Tip:** Expect questions like: _“Which plant is used to make quinine?”_ or _“Name a medicinal plant used for skin care.”_

---

##  2.5 Plants in Clothing and Industry

- **Cotton plants** → Cotton fabric
- **Jute plants** → Gunny bags, ropes, mats
- **Flax plants** → Linen fabric
- **Rubber plant** → Rubber used in tires, erasers
- **Bamboo** → Paper, furniture, even biofuel

Without plants, our clothes, bags, and many household products would not exist.

---

##  2.6 Plants and the Environment

Plants maintain balance in **nature’s cycles**:

1. **Carbon dioxide–oxygen cycle:**

   - Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
   - Animals take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.
   - This balance keeps Earth’s atmosphere stable.

2. **Water cycle:**

   - Plants release water vapor through **transpiration**.
   - This adds moisture to the atmosphere and helps form clouds.

3. **Soil conservation:**

   - Roots hold the soil together and prevent **erosion**.
   - Fallen leaves decay and add nutrients to the soil.

4. **Climate control:**

   - Forests absorb carbon dioxide, reducing global warming.
   - Trees provide shade and cool the environment.

---

##  2.7 Plants and Culture

Plants are also important in our cultural and spiritual life:

- Lotus is the national flower of India and a symbol of purity.
- Banyan tree is considered sacred in Hindu culture.
- Christmas tree (fir) is used in celebrations.
- Many festivals use flowers (Diwali, Onam, Holi).

This shows how deeply plants are connected to human traditions.

---

##  Mini Activity: Testing Starch in Leaves

**Aim:** To prove that leaves prepare starch during photosynthesis.

**Materials:** A green leaf, alcohol, iodine solution, beaker, hot water.

**Steps:**

1. Boil the leaf in water (to soften it).
2. Put the leaf in alcohol and heat in a hot water bath (to remove chlorophyll).
3. Wash the leaf in warm water.
4. Add a few drops of iodine solution.

**Observation:** The leaf turns blue-black, showing the presence of starch.

**Conclusion:** Leaves prepare starch through photosynthesis.

---

##  2.8 Plants and Animals – Mutual Dependence

Plants and animals are interdependent:

- **Animals depend on plants** for oxygen, food, and shelter.
- **Plants depend on animals** for pollination (bees, butterflies), seed dispersal (birds, animals), and carbon dioxide.

Without this partnership, ecosystems would collapse.

#  Section 3: Classification of Plants

---

##  Why Do We Classify Plants?

Imagine entering a library where all books are mixed up — storybooks, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and science journals all in one pile. It would be **impossible** to find the book you need. The same problem happens with plants.

There are **hundreds of thousands of plant species** on Earth. To study and understand them, scientists classify (group) plants based on their **similarities and differences**.

Classification helps in:

- Identifying plants easily
- Understanding their functions and roles
- Studying their relationships and evolution
- Using them for food, medicine, and industry

---

##  3.1 Basic Classification Based on Size and Stem

This is the simplest classification, taught at primary level.

- Weak stems that **spread along the ground**
- Bear large fruits
- Examples: Pumpkin, watermelon, bottle gourd

---

##  3.2 Classification Based on Habitat

Plants are also grouped according to the environment where they grow.

###  Terrestrial Plants (Land plants)

![Terrestrial](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-06-terrestrial.png)

- Grow on land
- Different adaptations depending on type of land

  - **Desert plants:** Thick stems, spines (cactus)
  - **Grassland plants:** Long roots to absorb water (grasses, wheat)
  - **Mountain plants:** Needle-shaped leaves, sloping branches (pine, fir)

###  Aquatic Plants (Water plants)

![Aquatic](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-07-aquatic.png)

- Grow in water (ponds, lakes, rivers, seas)
- 3 types:

  - **Floating plants:** Duckweed, water hyacinth
  - **Submerged plants:** Hydrilla, vallisneria
  - **Fixed plants:** Lotus, water lily

###  Epiphytes

- Grow on other plants, but not parasites
- Absorb water and nutrients from air
- Examples: Orchids, ferns

###  Parasitic Plants

![Parasitic](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-08-parasitic.jpg)

- Depend on other plants for food
- Have no chlorophyll
- Examples: Cuscuta (dodder), mistletoe

###  Mangrove Plants

![Mangrove](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-09-mangroves.jpg)

- Found in coastal areas where land meets seawater
- Have **special roots called pneumatophores** that grow above ground to take in oxygen
- Example: Sundari tree in Sundarbans

---

##  3.3 Classification Based on Life Cycle

Plants can also be grouped by how long they live.

1. **Annuals** – Live for **one season/year**

   - Grow, flower, produce seeds, and die within a year
   - Examples: Wheat, rice, sunflower

2. **Biennials** – Live for **two years**

   - First year: Grow roots, stems, and leaves
   - Second year: Flower and produce seeds
   - Examples: Carrot, beetroot, cabbage

3. **Perennials** – Live for **many years**

   - Usually woody plants like trees
   - Examples: Mango, banyan, neem, teak

---

##  3.4 Scientific Classification of Plants (Advanced Olympiad Concept)

For higher-level understanding, plants are divided into two major groups:

###  Non-Flowering Plants (Cryptogams)

- Do not produce flowers or seeds
- Reproduce by **spores**
- Subgroups:

  1. **Algae** – Simple plants found in water (e.g., Spirogyra, seaweed)
  2. **Mosses** – Small plants in damp places (e.g., Funaria)
  3. **Ferns** – Have big leaves, reproduce by spores (e.g., Nephrolepis)

###  Flowering Plants (Phanerogams)

- Have flowers, seeds, and well-developed structures
- Subgroups:

  1. **Gymnosperms** – Seeds not enclosed in fruit (naked seeds)

     - Example: Pine, cycas

  2. **Angiosperms** – Seeds enclosed in fruit

     - Divided into:

       - **Monocots** – One cotyledon in seed (wheat, rice, maize, grasses)
       - **Dicots** – Two cotyledons in seed (mango, rose, beans, sunflower)

---

##  3.5 Monocots vs Dicots (Olympiad-Focused)

| Feature       | Monocot Plants           | Dicot Plants          |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Cotyledons    | One                      | Two                   |
| Leaf venation | Parallel (e.g., grasses) | Reticulate (net-like) |
| Root system   | Fibrous roots            | Tap root system       |
| Examples      | Rice, wheat, maize, lily | Mango, beans, rose    |

This table is very important for Olympiad multiple-choice questions.

---

##  3.6 Economic Classification of Plants

Sometimes plants are grouped by **how humans use them**:

- **Food crops:** Wheat, rice, maize
- **Cash crops:** Cotton, sugarcane, tea, coffee
- **Medicinal plants:** Neem, tulsi, aloe vera
- **Ornamental plants:** Rose, orchid, hibiscus
- **Timber trees:** Teak, sal, mahogany
- **Fiber plants:** Cotton, jute, flax

---

##  Mini Activity: Observing Monocots and Dicots

Take two seeds — one of **pea (dicot)** and one of **maize (monocot)**. Soak them in water overnight. Peel off the seed coat and observe:

- Pea splits into two halves (two cotyledons).
- Maize remains in one piece (one cotyledon).

This simple experiment shows the difference between monocots and dicots clearly.

- **Herbs, shrubs, trees, climbers, and creepers** are simple size-based groups.
- **Terrestrial, aquatic, epiphytes, parasites, and mangroves** are based on habitat.
- **Annuals, biennials, and perennials** classify plants by lifespan.
- Scientifically, plants are grouped into **flowering and non-flowering plants**.
- **Monocots and dicots** are two important categories of angiosperms.
- Classification helps us **study, identify, and use plants** effectively.

---

#  Section 4: Structure of a Plant – External and Internal Parts

---

Plants, like animals, have **different parts with specific functions**. Each part plays a role in helping the plant grow, survive, and reproduce. To understand plants better, we divide their structure into two categories:

1. **External parts (visible from outside).**
2. **Internal parts (tissues and cells inside).**

---

##  4.1 External Structure of a Plant

The external structure can be divided into **two main systems**:

###  (A) The Root System

![Root](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-10-root.png)

Roots usually grow underground and anchor the plant firmly to the soil.

**Functions of roots:**

- Fix the plant to the soil.
- Absorb water and minerals from the soil.
- Store food in some plants (carrot, radish, beetroot).
- Hold soil particles together and prevent erosion.

**Types of roots:**

1. **Taproot system** – A single main root grows deep into the soil with smaller side roots (e.g., carrot, mango, mustard).
2. **Fibrous root system** – Many thin roots grow from the base of the stem (e.g., grass, wheat, rice).

**Special roots:**

- Prop roots in banyan trees (give extra support).
- Breathing roots in mangroves (help take in oxygen from air).
- Storage roots (store food, e.g., turnip, sweet potato).

---

###  (B) The Shoot System

![Shoot](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-11-shoot.jpg)

This includes the parts of the plant above the ground: stem, leaves, flowers, fruits.

####  Stem

- Supports the plant and holds leaves, flowers, and fruits.
- Carries water and minerals from roots to leaves.
- Carries food from leaves to other parts.
- Stores food in sugarcane and potato (which is a modified stem).

####  Leaves

- Called the “kitchen of the plant” because they make food by photosynthesis.
- Green due to **chlorophyll**.
- Flat and broad to capture sunlight.
- Tiny openings called **stomata** allow exchange of gases.
- Veins in leaves transport water and food.

**Types of leaves:**

- Simple leaf (mango, guava).
- Compound leaf (neem, rose).

####  Flower

Flowers are the **reproductive organs** of the plant.

- **Petals** – brightly colored to attract insects.
- **Sepals** – protect the bud before it blooms.
- **Stamens** – male part of the flower (anther + filament).
- **Carpel/Pistil** – female part (stigma, style, ovary).

![Flower](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-15-whorls.jpg)

**Importance of flowers:**

- Help in reproduction.
- Attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
- Some flowers are edible (broccoli, cauliflower).
- Provide fragrance and beauty.

####  Fruits and Seeds

- After fertilization, the **ovary develops into a fruit**.
- Fruits protect seeds.
- Seeds grow into new plants when conditions are right.

**Parts of a seed:**

- Seed coat (protects the seed).
- Cotyledons (store food for baby plant).
- Embryo (baby plant).

---

##  4.2 Internal Structure of a Plant

Just like humans have organs inside their bodies, plants have internal tissues.

**Main plant tissues:**

1. **Epidermis** – outer covering, protects the plant.
2. **Xylem** – transports water and minerals from roots to leaves.
3. **Phloem** – transports food made in leaves to other parts.
4. **Parenchyma** – stores food and water.
5. **Chloroplasts (in leaf cells)** – where photosynthesis happens.

Think of **xylem** as water pipes and **phloem** as food delivery pipes.

---

##  4.3 How Plant Parts Work Together

- Roots absorb water → stem transports → leaves use it for photosynthesis.
- Leaves make food → phloem carries it to roots, stems, and fruits.
- Flowers form fruits → fruits protect seeds → seeds give rise to new plants.

This teamwork keeps the plant alive and ensures the continuation of the species.

---

##  Mini Activity: To Observe Stomata in a Leaf

**Materials:** A leaf, microscope, nail polish.

**Steps:**

1. Apply nail polish on the underside of a leaf.
2. Peel it off after drying.
3. Place it under a microscope.

**Observation:** Tiny pores (stomata) can be seen.

**Conclusion:** Stomata help in gas exchange and transpiration.

##  Summary of Section 4

- Plants have two main systems: **root system** and **shoot system**.
- Roots absorb water and minerals, anchor plants, and sometimes store food.
- Stem supports and transports materials.
- Leaves make food through photosynthesis.
- Flowers help in reproduction and become fruits after fertilization.
- Fruits protect seeds, and seeds grow into new plants.
- Internally, plants have tissues like **xylem, phloem, and chloroplasts** to function efficiently.

# Section 4.5: Pollination

###  **What is Pollination?**

Pollination is the process by which **pollen** from the **anther** (male part) of a flower is transferred to the **stigma** (female part) of the same or another flower.

This is the **first step in the reproduction of flowering plants**.

## ![Flower](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-15-whorls.jpg)

###  **Parts of a Flower Involved in Pollination:**

| Part       | Function                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Anther** | Produces pollen grains               |
| **Stigma** | Receives pollen                      |
| **Style**  | Connects stigma to the ovary         |
| **Ovary**  | Contains ovules (which become seeds) |

---

### ️ **Types of Pollination:**

1. **Self-Pollination**

   - Pollen goes from the anther to the stigma **of the same flower**.
   - Example: Pea, Hibiscus

2. **Cross-Pollination**

   - Pollen goes from the anther of **one flower** to the stigma of **another flower** of the same kind.
   - Example: Apple, Sunflower

---

###  **Agents of Pollination:**

These help carry pollen from one flower to another:

| Agent       | Example                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Wind**    | Grass, wheat                           |
| **Water**   | Some aquatic plants                    |
| **Insects** | Bees, butterflies (most common agents) |
| **Birds**   | Hummingbirds                           |
| **Humans**  | Artificial pollination in farming      |

---

###  **Why is Pollination Important?**

- It leads to **fertilization** and **seed formation**.
- It helps **plants reproduce**.
- It is important for growing **fruits and vegetables**.

---

###  Quick Facts

- The transfer of pollen **must be of the same species**.
- After pollination, the pollen travels down the style to fertilize the ovule.
- Pollination is followed by **fertilization**, which leads to **seed and fruit formation**.

---

###  **Etymology of the word “Pollen”**

The word **_pollen_** comes from **Latin**:

- **Latin word**: _pollen_
- **Meaning**: "fine flour" or "dust"

---

###  Breakdown

- In ancient Latin, _pollen_ referred to **fine powder**, like that used for baking.
- Since **pollen grains** are also fine, powdery particles produced by flowers, the same word was used in science to describe them.
- The connection is based on **appearance and texture** — both are **tiny, grainy, and light**.

---

###  Related Words

- **Pollinate**: to spread or transfer pollen
- **Pollination**: the act or process of pollinating
- **Pollinator**: an agent (like bees) that carries pollen

---

###  **Etymology of the word “Anther”**

The word **_anther_** comes from:

- **Greek word**: _anthēra_ (ἀνθήρα)
- Derived from: _anthos_ (ἄνθος) meaning **“flower”**

---

###  Breakdown

- **Anthos** = “flower”
- **Anthēra** = “flowery” or “blooming part”
- Later borrowed into **Late Latin** as _anthera_
- Entered **English** in the 18th century (around 1700s) to describe the **part of a stamen that produces pollen**

---

###  Summary

> **Anther** means the **flowering or blooming part**, and it’s the **top part of the stamen** in a flower where **pollen is produced**.

---

###  **What is Style in a Flower?**

In a flower, the **style** is a **slender, tube-like part** of the female reproductive organ (called the **pistil**).

---

###  **Function of the Style:**

- It **connects the stigma** (top part) to the **ovary** (bottom part).
- After **pollination**, pollen grains land on the **stigma**.
- The pollen then **travels down the style** to reach the **ovary**, where **fertilization** happens.

---

###  **Parts of the Pistil (Female Part of a Flower):**

| Part       | Function                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Stigma** | Catches pollen                            |
| **Style**  | Passage for pollen to travel to the ovary |
| **Ovary**  | Contains ovules (will become seeds)       |

---

###  **Etymology of “Style”:**

- **Latin**: _stilus_
- Meaning: “a stake” or “pointed instrument”
- It refers to the **thin, stick-like shape** of the style in a flower.

---

###  **About Hibiscus**

- Belongs to the **Malvaceae family**, with hundreds of species like **Hibiscus rosa‑sinensis** and **Hibiscus syriacus** ([Home & Garden Information Center][1], [Wikipedia][2]).
- Each bloom typically **lasts just one day**, but the plant continues producing more throughout the season ([Better Homes & Gardens][3]).

---

###  **Why People Love Hibiscus**

- Their **large, showy flowers** come in a spectrum of colors—red, pink, orange, yellow, and even peach or purple ([Home & Garden Information Center][1]).
- Hibiscus flowers are a magnet for **butterflies**, **hummingbirds**, and other pollinators ([The Spruce][4]).

---

###  **Gardening Tips (From Reliable Sources)**

- Thrive in **warm climates** or well-lit indoor spots—ideally **65–75 °F** with plenty of sunlight .
- Prefer **moist, well-draining soil** and regular watering—never let the soil dry completely ([University of Minnesota Extension][5]).
- **Prune** in late winter or early spring to encourage healthy growth and new blooms ([University of Minnesota Extension][5]).

---

###  **What is a Pistil?**

The **pistil** is the **female reproductive part** of a flower.

It is located in the **center** of the flower and is made up of **three main parts**:

---

###  **Parts of the Pistil:**

| Part       | Function                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stigma** | The sticky top part that **receives pollen**       |
| **Style**  | The **tube** that connects the stigma to the ovary |
| **Ovary**  | The **swollen base** that contains the **ovules**  |

---

###  **What Happens in the Pistil?**

1. **Pollination**: Pollen lands on the **stigma**.
2. **Travel**: Pollen moves down through the **style**.
3. **Fertilization**: Pollen reaches the **ovules** inside the **ovary**.
4. **Seed Formation**: After fertilization, ovules become **seeds**, and the ovary becomes a **fruit**.

---

###  **Etymology of Pistil:**

- From **Latin** _pistillum_ → meaning **“pounder” or “pestle”**
- Named due to its **shape**, which is like a **grinding tool** used in old times.

---

###  Understanding the Pistil

**Pistil** = the **female reproductive part** of a flower. Typically located in the **center**, it consists of three main sections:

1. **Stigma**

   - Sticky tip that **receives pollen**.

2. **Style**

   - The **slender stalk** connecting stigma to ovary, through which pollen tubes travel ([Wikipedia][1]).

3. **Ovary**

   - Swollen base containing **ovules** (future seeds) ([byjus.com][2]).

---

###  Process Overview

| Step                  | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pollination**       | Pollen lands on the stigma.                                                                          |
| **Pollen Tubes Grow** | Through the style toward the ovary.                                                                  |
| **Fertilization**     | Sperm cells from pollen fertilize the ovule.                                                         |
| **Seed & Fruit**      | Ovules become seeds; the ovary develops into a fruit ([byjus.com][2], [Encyclopedia Britannica][3]). |

---

###  Quick Fact: Pistil vs Carpel

- **Carpel** is a single unit; when multiple carpels are fused, they form one **pistil**.
- A flower may have **one pistil** (simple) or **many fused/multiple pistils** (compound) ([Encyclopedia Britannica][3], [GeeksforGeeks][4]).

#  The Four Whorls of a Flower

##  Introduction

Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants. They are not just beautiful—they also play a very important role in the life cycle of the plant. One of the best ways to understand a flower is to look at its structure.

A typical flower has **four main parts**, known as **whorls**. These whorls are arranged in **circles** around the central part of the flower. Each whorl has a specific job to do.

![Flower](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-15-whorls.jpg)

Let’s explore these four whorls one by one:

1. **Calyx**
2. **Corolla**
3. **Androecium**
4. **Gynoecium**

---

##  1. **Calyx** – The Outer Whorl

###  Definition

The **calyx** is the **outermost whorl** of a flower. It is usually green and leaf-like and is made up of individual units called **sepals**.

###  Function

- **Protects** the flower when it is in the **bud stage**
- Helps in **photosynthesis** if green
- In some flowers, the calyx stays even after blooming and helps **protect the fruit**

###  Etymology

- **Latin**: _calyx_ = "cup" or "husk"
- It refers to the cup-like structure that encloses the bud

###  Examples

- In **Hibiscus**, the calyx is clearly visible as green leaf-like parts beneath the petals.
- In **brinjal (eggplant)** flowers, the calyx persists and forms the green part under the fruit.

---

##  2. **Corolla** – The Petal Whorl

###  Definition

The **corolla** is the **second whorl**, made up of **petals**. Petals are often **brightly colored** and **fragrant**.

###  Function

- Attracts **insects, birds, and pollinators** with its color and smell
- Helps in **guiding** pollinators to the nectar and reproductive parts
- In some plants, petals can also **protect inner parts** like sepals

###  Etymology

- **Latin**: _corolla_ = "little crown"
- Because petals often form a crown-like shape around the center of the flower

###  Examples

- In **rose**, the corolla is made up of the large, showy pink or red petals.
- In **sunflower**, the large yellow “petals” are actually part of the corolla.

---

##  3. **Androecium** – The Male Whorl

###  Definition

The **androecium** is the **third whorl** and is the **male reproductive part** of the flower. It consists of **stamens**, and each stamen has two main parts:

1. **Anther** – produces **pollen grains**
2. **Filament** – holds up the anther

###  Function

- Produces **pollen**, which contains the **male gametes (sperm cells)**
- Helps in **pollination** when insects or wind carry pollen to another flower

###  Etymology

- **Greek**: _andros_ = "man" + _oikos_ = "house" → “house of man”
- Refers to the part of the flower that produces male gametes

###  Examples

- In **lily**, you can clearly see six long stamens with yellow anthers.
- In **Hibiscus**, the stamens are joined together in a long tube surrounding the pistil.

---

###  Note

In some flowers, all stamens are **separate**. In others, they may be **fused** by their filaments or anthers.

---

##  4. **Gynoecium** – The Female Whorl

###  Definition

The **gynoecium** is the **innermost whorl** and is the **female reproductive part** of the flower. It is made up of one or more **carpels** (or pistils).

Each **carpel** has three main parts:

1. **Stigma** – sticky part that receives pollen
2. **Style** – tube that carries pollen down to the ovary
3. **Ovary** – contains **ovules** (eggs)

###  Function

- Receives **pollen** during pollination
- **Fertilization** happens inside the ovary when the male and female gametes meet
- Ovary later develops into a **fruit**, and ovules become **seeds**

###  Etymology

- **Greek**: _gynē_ = "woman" + _oikos_ = "house" → “house of woman”
- Refers to the part that produces and carries the **female gametes (egg cells)**

###  Examples

- In **pea plants**, the ovary is found at the base of the flower and develops into a pod.
- In **hibiscus**, the stigma is at the tip, surrounded by stamens, and the ovary is hidden at the base.

##  Summary Table

| Whorl          | Parts                            | Function                                   | Male/Female/Neutral |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Calyx**      | Sepals                           | Protects the bud, sometimes photosynthesis | Neutral             |
| **Corolla**    | Petals                           | Attracts pollinators                       | Neutral             |
| **Androecium** | Stamens (Anther + Filament)      | Produces pollen                            | Male                |
| **Gynoecium**  | Carpels (Stigma + Style + Ovary) | Produces ovules, fertilization             | Female              |

---

##  Perfect and Imperfect Flowers

- **Perfect Flower**: Has all **four whorls** (e.g., Hibiscus, Rose)
- **Imperfect Flower**: Missing either androecium or gynoecium (e.g., Papaya, Corn)

---

##  Additional Notes

###  Modified Whorls

- In some flowers, parts like petals and sepals may look **similar** and are called **tepals** (e.g., lily).
- Some flowers have fused sepals or petals to form **tubes** or **bells**.

###  Floral Formula

In higher classes, flowers can be represented using a **floral formula** and **floral diagram** to show whorls clearly.

---

##  Fun Activities for Class 5

###  1. **Dissect a Flower** (with teacher’s help)

Take a hibiscus flower and carefully remove each whorl. Identify sepals, petals, stamens, and pistil.

### ️ 2. **Label a Diagram**

Draw a flower and label the four whorls with colors:

- Green for sepals
- Pink/red for petals
- Yellow for stamens
- Blue for pistil

###  3. **Flower Hunt**

Find 3 flowers with all four whorls and 2 that are missing one whorl. Make a table!

---

##  Conclusion

The **four whorls**—calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium—are what make a flower both beautiful and functional. Each whorl has a specific role, whether it's protecting the flower, attracting pollinators, or helping the plant reproduce.

Learning about these whorls helps us appreciate how flowers are **perfectly designed by nature** to support life and growth. Understanding these basic building blocks also lays the foundation for learning **plant reproduction**, **pollination**, **fruit formation**, and more in higher classes.

#  Section 5: Photosynthesis – The Food Factory of Plants

---

Plants are called the **producers** of the Earth because they prepare their own food. The process through which they make food is known as **photosynthesis**. The word comes from:

- **Photo** = light
- **Synthesis** = putting together

So, photosynthesis means **“putting together with the help of light.”**

![photosynthesis](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-12-phtosynthesis.jpg)

---

## ️ 5.1 What is Photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use **sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO₂), and water (H₂O)** to make **food (glucose)** and release **oxygen (O₂)**.

The overall **chemical equation** is:

$$
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Sunlight + Chlorophyll → C₆H₁₂O₆ (Glucose) + 6O₂
$$

In words:
Carbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen

---

##  5.2 Ingredients Needed for Photosynthesis

For photosynthesis to happen, four main things are needed:

1. **Sunlight** – the energy source.
2. **Chlorophyll** – the green pigment in leaves that captures sunlight.
3. **Water** – absorbed by roots from the soil.
4. **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** – taken in through stomata (tiny pores in leaves).

---

##  5.3 The Process Step by Step

1. Roots absorb **water** from the soil and send it to the leaves through xylem.
2. Leaves take in **carbon dioxide** from the air through stomata.
3. Chlorophyll inside leaf cells captures **sunlight**.
4. Using sunlight’s energy, the plant converts water and carbon dioxide into **glucose (food)**.
5. As a by-product, **oxygen** is released into the air.

This is why plants are called the **lungs of the Earth** – they give us oxygen to breathe.

---

##  5.4 Where Does Photosynthesis Happen?

Photosynthesis occurs mainly in the **leaves**.

- Inside each leaf cell are small green structures called **chloroplasts**.
- Each chloroplast contains **chlorophyll** – the green pigment that traps sunlight.
- This is why only green plants can make their own food.

---

##  5.5 Importance of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the most important process on Earth. Without it, life would not exist.

**Importance for plants:**

- Provides food for the plant itself.
- Stores energy in the form of starch.

**Importance for animals and humans:**

- Provides oxygen for breathing.
- Produces food (directly or indirectly).
- Forms the basis of the food chain.

**Importance for Earth:**

- Balances gases in the atmosphere by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.
- Helps reduce global warming (since CO₂ is absorbed).

---

##  5.6 Experiment: To Prove Photosynthesis Produces Starch

**Aim:** To show that leaves prepare starch during photosynthesis.

**Materials:** Potted plant, iodine solution, alcohol, beaker.

**Steps:**

1. Keep the plant in dark for 24 hours (so all starch is used up).
2. Place it in sunlight for 4–6 hours.
3. Pluck a leaf and boil it in water (to soften it).
4. Then boil it in alcohol (to remove green chlorophyll).
5. Wash the leaf and add iodine solution.

**Observation:** The leaf turns **blue-black**, showing the presence of starch.

**Conclusion:** Photosynthesis produces starch (stored food).

---

##  5.7 Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

Several factors influence the rate of photosynthesis:

1. **Sunlight** – more light = more photosynthesis, up to a limit.
2. **Carbon dioxide concentration** – more CO₂ increases the rate.
3. **Water** – lack of water slows down photosynthesis.
4. **Temperature** – too low or too high temperature reduces the rate.
5. **Chlorophyll** – only green parts of the plant can photosynthesize.

---

##  5.8 Photosynthesis and the Food Chain

- Plants (producers) make food.
- Herbivores (like cows, goats) eat plants.
- Carnivores (like lions) eat herbivores.
- Omnivores (like humans) eat both plants and animals.

Thus, photosynthesis is the **starting point of all food chains**. Without plants, there would be no food for any living creature.

---

##  5.9 Fun Facts about Photosynthesis

- 70% of oxygen in the atmosphere is produced by tiny plants in oceans called **phytoplankton**.
- Desert plants (cactus) perform photosynthesis with their stems instead of leaves.
- Photosynthesis not only produces food but also fuels fossil fuels (coal, petroleum) since they are ancient plant matter.

#  Section 6: Plant Reproduction – How Plants Make New Plants

---

##  6.1 What is Reproduction?

**Reproduction** is the process by which living things produce new individuals of their own kind.
For plants, reproduction ensures that the species does not disappear from Earth.

Plants reproduce in **two main ways**:

1. **Asexual reproduction** – New plants grow from parts like roots, stems, or leaves.
2. **Sexual reproduction** – New plants grow from seeds formed after pollination and fertilization.

---

##  6.2 Asexual Reproduction in Plants

In this type, only **one parent plant** is needed. No seeds are involved.

![asexual](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-13-asexual.jpg)

###  Methods of Asexual Reproduction

1. **Vegetative Propagation (by roots, stems, or leaves)**

   - **Roots**: Sweet potato, carrot, dahlia.
   - **Stems**: Potato (tubers), onion (bulbs), ginger (rhizomes), strawberry (runners).
   - **Leaves**: Bryophyllum (new plants grow from leaf edges).

2. **Cuttings**

   - A part of the stem is cut and planted in soil.
   - Example: Rose, hibiscus, sugarcane.

3. **Layering**

   - A branch is bent and covered with soil. Roots grow and form a new plant.
   - Example: Jasmine, bougainvillea.

4. **Grafting**

   - Two plants are joined together – one provides the roots (stock), the other the stem/flowers (scion).
   - Example: Mango, rose.

5. **Tissue Culture** (advanced method)

   - A very small piece of plant tissue is grown in special conditions in a lab.
   - Used to produce thousands of plants quickly.

 Asexual reproduction produces **exact copies (clones)** of the parent plant.

---

##  6.3 Sexual Reproduction in Plants

This is the most common way plants reproduce. It involves **flowers, seeds, and fruits**.

![sexual](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-14-sexual.jpg)

###  The Role of Flowers

Flowers are the **reproductive organs of plants**.

- **Male part (Stamen)** → produces pollen.
- **Female part (Carpel/Pistil)** → contains ovary with ovules.

###  Steps of Sexual Reproduction

1. **Pollination** – transfer of pollen from the stamen (male) to the stigma (female).

   - **Self-pollination**: Pollen from same flower.
   - **Cross-pollination**: Pollen transferred from one flower to another (via wind, water, insects, birds).

2. **Fertilization** – pollen grain reaches the ovary and fuses with the ovule.

3. **Seed Formation** – fertilized ovule develops into a seed.

4. **Fruit Formation** – ovary becomes fruit; seeds are inside.

---

##  6.4 Seed Dispersal

If all seeds fall near the parent plant, they will compete for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
So, seeds are dispersed to different places by:

- **Wind** – light seeds like dandelion, maple.
- **Water** – floating seeds like coconut, lotus.
- **Animals** – seeds with hooks (burdock) stick to fur, or fruits are eaten and seeds dropped.
- **Explosion** – pea and balsam pods burst and scatter seeds.

---

##  6.5 Germination of Seeds

When a seed falls on soil with the right conditions (water, air, warmth), it begins to grow into a new plant.

###  Conditions needed for germination

- **Water (moisture)** – softens seed coat.
- **Air (oxygen)** – for respiration.
- **Warmth** – suitable temperature.

###  Stages of germination

1. Seed absorbs water and swells.
2. Seed coat breaks.
3. Tiny root (radicle) comes out first.
4. Shoot (plumule) grows upward.
5. Leaves form and begin photosynthesis.

---

##  6.6 Importance of Plant Reproduction

- Ensures survival of species.
- Produces new varieties (by cross-pollination).
- Provides seeds, fruits, and crops for humans.
- Maintains balance in ecosystems.

---

##  6.7 Fun Facts about Plant Reproduction

- A single dandelion plant can produce thousands of seeds carried by wind.
- Coconut is the world champion of **water dispersal** – it can travel thousands of kilometers across seas.
- Bananas sold in markets are **seedless** – they are grown by vegetative propagation.
- The world’s largest seed is the **Coco de Mer** (double coconut) – it can weigh up to **25 kg**!

#  Section 7: Plant Adaptations – How Plants Survive in Different Environments

---

##  7.1 What are Plant Adaptations?

**Adaptations** are special features or changes in structure, function, or behavior that help a plant survive in its environment.

- Without adaptations, plants would not be able to live in extreme conditions like deserts, oceans, or snowy mountains.
- These changes can affect roots, stems, leaves, seeds, and even reproduction.

---

## ️ 7.2 Adaptations in Desert Plants

Desert plants (xerophytes) live in places where **water is scarce** and temperatures are high.

###  Key Adaptations

- **Thick, waxy stems** → store water (e.g., cactus).
- **Leaves reduced to spines** → reduce water loss.
- **Green stems** → perform photosynthesis instead of leaves.
- **Deep roots** → reach underground water.
- **Shallow, widespread roots** → absorb rainwater quickly.

###  Examples

- **Cactus**: stores water, has spines for protection.
- **Opuntia**: flat, green pads act like leaves.
- **Date palm**: long roots and tough leaves to survive sandstorms.

---

##  7.3 Adaptations in Aquatic Plants

Aquatic plants (hydrophytes) live in **water bodies** like ponds, rivers, and lakes.

###  Types of Aquatic Plants & Their Adaptations

1. **Floating Plants** (e.g., water hyacinth, duckweed)

   - Light and spongy stems → keep them afloat.
   - Stomata (tiny pores) on upper surface of leaves → for breathing.

2. **Fixed Plants** (e.g., water lily, lotus)

   - Roots fix them to soil under water.
   - Broad, flat leaves float on surface → absorb sunlight.
   - Long, flexible stems → sway with water flow.

3. **Submerged Plants** (e.g., hydrilla, vallisneria)

   - Thin, ribbon-like leaves → allow easy water movement.
   - No stomata → gases directly absorbed from water.
   - Entire plant remains underwater.

---

##  7.4 Adaptations in Tropical Rainforest Plants

Rainforest plants live in hot, wet places with **dense tree cover**.

###  Key Adaptations

- **Large leaves with drip tips** → help shed excess rainwater.
- **Climbing vines (lianas)** → climb tall trees to get sunlight.
- **Epiphytes (orchids, ferns)** → grow on other plants to reach light.
- **Tall trees with buttress roots** → provide support in soft soil.

###  Example

- **Orchid** → grows high on trees without harming them.
- **Kapok tree** → tall with huge buttress roots.

---

## ️ 7.5 Adaptations in Cold-Region Plants

Plants in mountains and polar regions face **snow, freezing winds, and short growing seasons**.

###  Key Adaptations

- **Conical shape** → allows snow to slide off.
- **Needle-like leaves** → reduce water loss and resist freezing.
- **Evergreen habit** → stay green throughout the year to photosynthesize whenever possible.
- **Thick bark** → protects from extreme cold.

###  Examples

- **Pine, spruce, fir** → needle-leaved conifers.
- **Alpine plants** → grow close to the ground to avoid strong winds.

---

##  7.6 Adaptations in Grassland Plants

Grasslands have **long dry seasons and grazing animals**.

###  Key Adaptations

- **Narrow leaves** → reduce water loss.
- **Flexible stems** → bend with strong winds.
- **Deep roots** → absorb water and anchor against grazing.
- **Fast regrowth** → survive grazing by animals.

 Example: Grasses, acacia trees.

---

##  7.7 Adaptations in Mangrove Plants

Mangroves grow in **salty coastal water** where soil is muddy and low in oxygen.

###  Key Adaptations

- **Breathing roots (pneumatophores)** → stick out of soil to take in oxygen.
- **Thick, waxy leaves** → prevent water loss.
- **Salt glands** → excrete extra salt.

 Example: Sundari tree (found in Sundarbans, India).

---

##  7.8 Human Influence and Plant Adaptation

- Humans cut forests → plants must adapt to pollution and urban areas.
- Some plants (like weeds) adapt quickly to new environments.
- Climate change is forcing many plants to shift habitats or risk extinction.

---

#  Section 9: Plant Growth and Development – How Plants Grow

---

##  9.1 Introduction

All living things grow and change, and plants are no exception. Plant growth is not random—it follows a **life cycle** that begins with a seed and ends with a mature plant that produces more seeds. Plants also respond to their environment—sunlight, water, soil, and air—helping them grow properly.

Plant growth is a fascinating process because it shows how a tiny seed can become a tall tree.

---

##  9.2 Life Cycle of a Plant

A plant’s life cycle has several stages:

1. **Seed stage**

   - The life of most plants begins as a seed.
   - Seeds contain an **embryo** (baby plant), **cotyledons** (stored food), and a **seed coat** (protective layer).

2. **Germination**

   - When a seed gets water, oxygen, and the right temperature, it starts to sprout.
   - The seed coat breaks open.
   - The root (radicle) comes out first, followed by the shoot (plumule).

3. **Seedling stage**

   - The small plant grows leaves and roots.
   - It starts photosynthesis to make its own food.

4. **Mature plant**

   - The plant develops flowers, fruits, and more leaves.
   - It becomes strong enough to reproduce.

5. **Reproduction stage**

   - Flowers produce seeds through pollination and fertilization.
   - The cycle continues with new seeds.

 Example: The life cycle of a bean plant can be observed within weeks, making it a favorite experiment for students.

---

##  9.3 Conditions Needed for Plant Growth

Plants need certain conditions to grow well:

1. **Sunlight** 

   - Required for photosynthesis.
   - Without sunlight, plants become weak and yellow.

2. **Water** 

   - Helps seeds germinate and transports nutrients.
   - Too much water causes roots to rot.

3. **Soil and minerals** 

   - Soil provides anchorage and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium).
   - Fertile soil helps plants grow faster and healthier.

4. **Air** ️

   - Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and oxygen for respiration.

5. **Temperature** ️

   - Each plant has a preferred temperature.
   - For example: Rice grows in warm areas, while wheat grows better in cooler areas.

---

##  9.4 Growth in Plants

Unlike animals, plants grow throughout their lives.

- **Meristems**: Special tissues where growth happens.

  - **Apical meristem**: At the tips of roots and shoots (length growth).
  - **Lateral meristem**: In stems and roots (thickness growth).

- **Primary growth**: Increase in length.

- **Secondary growth**: Increase in thickness (seen in trees as rings of wood).

 Fun fact: You can find the **age of a tree** by counting its growth rings.

---

##  9.5 Reproduction in Plants

Plants reproduce in different ways:

1. **Sexual reproduction** (using seeds)

   - Male part: **Stamen** (produces pollen).
   - Female part: **Carpel** (contains ovary with ovules).
   - **Pollination**: Transfer of pollen from stamen to carpel.
   - **Fertilization**: Fusion of male and female gametes to form a seed.

2. **Asexual reproduction** (without seeds)

   - **Cuttings**: New plants grow from parts (rose, hibiscus).
   - **Runners**: Strawberry spreads through runners.
   - **Tubers**: Potato grows from underground stems.
   - **Bulbs**: Onion, garlic.

---

##  9.6 Fruit and Seed Formation

- After fertilization, the ovary becomes a **fruit**.
- The ovules inside become **seeds**.
- Fruits protect seeds and help in dispersal.

  - **Fleshy fruits**: Mango, apple, orange.
  - **Dry fruits**: Pea, groundnut.

---

##  9.7 Seed Dispersal

Seeds must be spread away from the parent plant to avoid competition. Methods include:

1. **Wind**: Light seeds (dandelion, cotton) float in the air.
2. **Water**: Coconuts float on water and travel long distances.
3. **Animals**: Fruits like mango and berries are eaten, and seeds are spread. Sticky seeds cling to animal fur.
4. **Explosion**: Some pods (pea, balsam) burst open and throw seeds.

 Seed dispersal ensures survival of plant species in new areas.

---

##  9.8 Photosynthesis and Growth

Plants make their own food through photosynthesis.

- Raw materials: Carbon dioxide + Water
- With sunlight and chlorophyll, they produce:

  - **Glucose (food)**
  - **Oxygen (waste product for plant, but essential for animals)**

Photosynthesis is the **engine of plant growth**.

---

##  9.9 Plant Hormones

Just like humans have hormones, plants also have hormones that control growth.

- **Auxins**: Help in lengthening of shoots.
- **Gibberellins**: Promote stem growth.
- **Cytokinins**: Help in cell division.
- **Ethylene**: Helps fruits ripen.
- **Abscisic acid**: Controls leaf fall and dormancy.

---
