# **Work, Force, and Energy**

---

## **Section 1: Introduction to Work, Force, and Energy**

When you push a swing, pull a bag, ride a bicycle, or even eat food, you are experiencing the effects of work, force, and energy. These concepts form the foundation of physics.

Let us break them down:

* **Force** is a push or pull that changes how objects move.
* **Work** is done when a force moves an object in its direction.
* **Energy** is the ability to do work.

Together, these three ideas explain why things move, why machines work, and how life itself is possible.

Force is a push or a pull which acts on an object. A pull is a force that moves something towards you while a push is one that moves something away from you. A force can make an object move, stop its movement, change its direction of movement or change its shape.

---

## **Section 2: Force**

### **2.1 What is Force?**

A **force** is a **push or pull** upon an object resulting from its interaction with another object. Whenever two objects interact, a force is exerted. Forces can make objects move, stop, change direction, change speed, or even change shape.

Think of some daily examples:

* When you push a shopping cart, you apply force.
* When a magnet attracts an iron nail, it exerts force.
* When you kick a football, you use force to make it move.

Without force, the world would be motionless—nothing would move, and no work would ever be done.

---

### **2.2 Effects of Force**

Forces can bring about several changes:

1. **Change in Motion:** A force can make a stationary object move or stop a moving object. Example: A ball starts rolling when you kick it.

2. **Change in Speed:** A force can increase or decrease the speed of an object. Example: A car accelerates when you press the accelerator.

3. **Change in Direction:** A force can make an object change its path. Example: A cricket ball changes direction after hitting the bat.

4. **Change in Shape:** A force can deform objects. Example: Pressing clay changes its shape.

---

### **2.3 Types of Force**

Forces can be grouped into **Contact Forces** and **Non-contact Forces**.

#### **2.3.1 Contact Forces**

These act only when objects are in direct contact.

* **Muscular Force:** The force we apply using our muscles. Example: lifting, pushing, pulling.
* **Frictional Force:** The force that opposes motion when two surfaces rub against each other. Example: rubbing hands together.
* **Applied Force:** Any force applied by a person or an object directly.

#### **2.3.2 Non-contact Forces**

These act without direct contact between objects.

* **Gravitational Force:** The pull of the Earth on objects, keeping us grounded.
* **Magnetic Force:** The attraction or repulsion between magnets and magnetic materials.
* **Electrostatic Force:** The force between charged objects, like when a comb attracts paper bits after rubbing.

---

### **2.4 Balanced and Unbalanced Forces**

* **Balanced Forces:** Equal and opposite forces that cancel each other. No movement occurs. Example: A book resting on a table.

* **Unbalanced Forces:** One force is stronger, causing movement. Example: Tug of war when one team pulls harder.

---

# **Section 3: Work**

---

### **3.1 What is Work?**

In everyday language, we often say things like:

* “I worked hard today.”
* “This homework took a lot of work.”

But in science, the meaning of **work** is very precise.

Work is said to be done when a **force is applied to an object** and the object **moves in the direction of the force**.

So, in science:

* If you **push a chair** and it moves, you have done work.
* If you **lift a schoolbag**, you have done work.
* But if you **push a wall** and it doesn’t move, no work is done (scientifically, even though you feel tired).

When you lifted the pile of books, you applied an upward force that moved the pile up. You did some work. When you tried to place the books in the cupboard, you found it difficult because you had to apply a greater force to lift the books through a greater distance. You had to do more work to complete this task.

Work is done when a force acts on an object and moves it some distance in the direction in which the force acts. The distance moved by an object in the direction in which a force acts is called displacement.

The conditions for work to be done are as follows.
- a force is applied to an object
- the object is displaced in the direction of the force applied
---

### **3.2 Conditions for Work**

There are **three essential conditions**:

1. **A force must be applied.** Without force, no work can be done.

2. **The object must be displaced (moved). ** If there is no movement, no work is done.

3. **The displacement must be in the direction of force. ** If you apply force in one direction but the object moves in another, no scientific work is done.

---

### **3.3 Examples of Work in Daily Life**

  * **Work Done:**

    * Lifting a bucket of water.
    * Pushing a car and it moves forward.
    - writing
    - pushing a shopping cart
    - playing badminton
    - mixing vegetables while cooking
    - moving the coins on a carrom board with a striker

  * **Work NOT Done (scientifically):**

    * A child pushing against a wall.
    * Holding a bag in hand without moving it.
    * Sitting still while feeling tired.
    - sleeping, reading or thinking
    - carrying a school bag but standing still
    - pushing a door the wrong way
    - pushing a heavy cupboard which does not move

---

### **3.4 Measuring Work**

Scientists measure work using a formula:

Work = Force * Distance moved in the direction of force

* **Force** is measured in Newtons (N).
* **Distance** is measured in meters (m).
* The unit of work is the **Joule (J)**.

**1 Joule of work** is done when a force of **1 Newton** moves an object through a distance of **1 meter** in the direction of the force.

**Example:**
If you push a box with 5 Newtons of force and it moves 2 meters, the work done is:

Work = 5 * 2 = 10 Joules

---

### **3.5 Positive and Negative Work**

* **Positive Work:** When the force applied and the displacement are in the same direction. Example: Pushing a car forward and it moves forward.

* **Negative Work:** When the force applied is opposite to the direction of motion. Example: Friction force when a car is moving, or brakes applied in a cycle.

---

### **3.7 Work and Simple Machines**

Machines are tools that make our work easier. They do not reduce the total work, but they reduce the **effort** required or change the **direction** of force.

Examples:

* **Lever:** Lifting heavy objects with a crowbar.
* **Pulley:** Pulling water from a well.
* **Inclined Plane:** Sliding objects up a ramp instead of lifting straight.

These machines help us do the same work with less effort.

---

### **3.8 Misconceptions about Work**

Students often confuse the scientific meaning of work with daily use.

* **Carrying a heavy load:** In science, if you carry a bag on your head and just walk straight, no work is done (because the force is vertical but displacement is horizontal).
* **Tiring activities:** Standing still while holding a bag is tiring, but scientifically, no work is done because there is no displacement.

---

### **3.9 Work Done by Different Forces**

1. **Work Done by Gravity:** When you drop an object, gravity does work by pulling it downwards.

2. **Work Done Against Friction:** When you slide a box on the floor, friction resists the movement. You must do work against friction.

3. **Work Done by Machines:** Engines, pumps, and turbines all perform work by applying continuous force to move objects.

---

# **Section 4: Energy**

---

### **4.1 What is Energy?**

In science, **energy is the ability to do work**.
Whenever we perform any task—whether it is running, playing, writing, or even thinking—we are using energy.

* When we eat food, our body gets energy to move, breathe, and stay alive.
* When you switch on a light bulb, electricity provides the energy to produce light.
* When you cycle downhill, gravity provides energy to make you go faster.

Without energy, there would be no motion, no sound, no light, and no life.

 **Key Point:** Work and energy are closely linked. Work is the transfer of energy from one object to another.

You may have seen tennis players eat a banana between games or long-distance runners have a drink containing glucose. Why do you think they have a banana or some glucose? It is because these foods give them instant energy. So what is energy? Why do we need energy?

Energy is the ability or capacity to do work. We need energy to do all our work—to ride a bicycle, push a cart, play football, or do any kind of activity. When we ride a bicycle over a long distance, do we not get tired after a while? If we stop, relax and eat something, we feel refreshed and ready to continue.

---
### Energy-giving Foods

Where do we get energy from? We get energy from the food we eat. Carbohydrates and fats are sources of energy. Our body breaks down the food we eat to get energy. Cereals (grains) contain carbohydrates. Butter, cheese, eggs, meat, nuts are rich in fats. These foods give us more energy than other foods like dals, fresh fruits or vegetables. However banana (a fruit) and potato (a vegetable) are high in carbohydrates, and are sources of energy.

Machines also need energy to do work. Where do they get energy from? They get energy from fuel or electricity.

### Why is Energy Needed for Work?

When we are very hungry, we are not able to do work. But after eating, we find that we are able to work. Food gives us the energy needed to do work. Energy is transferred from the food to our body. Our body needs this energy to do work.

### The Difference between Work and Energy

Take the example of a girl playing football. When she kicks the football, she uses the energy she has to move the ball. Her kicking the football and moving it in the direction of the force applied is the work done. Therefore, energy is used when work is done.

--- 

### **4.2 Units of Energy**

Like work, energy is also measured in **Joules (J)**.

* **1 Joule of energy** is required to do **1 Joule of work**.

---

### **4.3 Forms of Energy**

Energy appears in many forms. Some are visible (like light), some are invisible (like heat).

Let’s explore each type:

#### **4.3.1 Mechanical Energy**

This is the energy an object has due to its **motion** or **position**.

The energy that an object has because of its position or movement is called mechanical energy. There are two forms of mechanical energy.

The energy that an object has because of its position is called potential energy. When an object is at rest in a position, it has stored energy and the ability to do work once it starts moving. Examples of objects that have potential energy are water stored in a dam or a stretched bow.

The energy that an object has because of its movement is called kinetic energy. Examples of objects that have kinetic energy are a flowing river or a moving car.

It has two main forms:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Energy of a moving object. Example: A running car, a flying bird, a rolling ball.
* **Potential Energy:** Stored energy due to position or shape. Example: Water stored in a dam, a stretched rubber band, a book kept on a shelf.

 **Connection:** Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.


---

#### **4.3.2 Heat Energy (Thermal Energy)**

* Heat energy is produced when particles of matter move or vibrate faster.
- We get heat energy by burning fuels such as wood, coal and petrol. Heat energy is used to cook food, run vehicles, keep us warm in winter, generate electricity and so on. Some sources of heat energy are the Sun, burning wood and heaters.

**Examples:**

  * Fire burning wood.
  * The Sun warming Earth.
  * A hot cup of tea.

---

#### **4.3.3 Light Energy**

* Light energy is given out by luminous objects (things that produce their own light).
* Examples: Sun, torch, light bulb, fireflies.
* Light is essential for plants (photosynthesis) and for human vision.
- Light energy helps us see things around us. We get light energy from the Sun, fire, electric bulbs, tube lights, candles and so on.

---

#### **4.3.4 Sound Energy**

* Produced by vibrating objects.
* Examples: Guitar strings, beating drums, human voice.
* Sound helps in communication, music, and alerts.
- Sound is a form of energy that is produced when an object vibrates. We are able to talk because our vocal cords (specific parts in our voice box) vibrate to produce sounds. Some sources of sound energy are musical instruments like drums and guitars, the radio, loudspeakers and so on.

---

#### **4.3.5 Chemical Energy**

* Stored inside substances and released during chemical reactions.
* Examples: Food, coal, petrol, batteries.
* Plants store chemical energy during photosynthesis.
- The food we eat, coal and petroleum all contain chemical energy. Burning of these substances releases the chemical energy inside them.

---

#### **4.3.6 Electrical Energy**

* Produced by the movement of electric charges.
* Examples: Fans, refrigerators, computers, mobile phones.
* One of the most widely used forms of energy in modern life.
- Electricity is a form of energy used for heating and lighting. We use it to run machines at home, and in offices and factories. It is produced in power stations by burning fuels like coal and petroleum, or from running water, wind or other sources.

---

#### **4.3.7 Nuclear Energy**

* Stored inside the nucleus of atoms.
* Released during nuclear reactions.
* Examples: Nuclear power plants, energy from the Sun (fusion reactions).

---
#### Magnetic Energy 

The energy that objects called magnets have, with which they can attract (pull) and/or repel (push away) some objects, is called magnetic energy. A fridge magnet is an example. Magnetic energy is used to sort, lift or hold substances and to keep doors closed.

--- 
#### **4.3.8 Other Forms**

* **Elastic Energy:** In stretched or compressed materials (rubber bands, springs).
* **Geothermal Energy:** Heat from inside the Earth (hot springs, volcanoes).
* **Hydropower:** Energy from moving water (dams, waterfalls).

---

### **4.4 Sources of Energy**

Energy must come from somewhere. Sources are divided into two groups:

#### **4.4.1 Renewable Sources**

Some sources of energy will either never run out or be renewed naturally within a short period of time. These are called renewable sources of energy. Some forms of renewable energy are explained below. They cause less pollution than burning fuels do.

- Solar energy Energy obtained from sunlight is called solar energy. We get heat and light from sunlight. It supports life on Earth since photosynthesis happens only in the presence of sunlight.
- Water energy (hydropower) Energy from flowing or falling water is called hydropower. The potential and kinetic energy in stored and moving water are used to generate electricity.
- Wind energy When wind blows, it causes a flag to flutter and fly. Is the wind doing work? Yes! Wind is a form of energy. The kinetic energy in wind can be used to move the blades of windmills to generate electricity and also to do work.

Can be replenished naturally and will not run out quickly.

* **Solar Energy:** From the Sun.
* **Wind Energy:** From moving air.
* **Water Energy:** From rivers and dams.
* **Biomass Energy:** From plants, animals, and organic matter.
* **Geothermal Energy:** From heat beneath the Earth’s surface.

 Advantage: Clean, unlimited, eco-friendly.

---

#### **4.4.2 Non-Renewable Sources**

Some sources of energy take millions of years to form and cannot be renewed once they are used up.

Fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas are examples of non-renewable sources of energy.

Available in limited quantities; once used, they cannot be easily replaced.

* **Coal**
* **Petroleum (oil)**
* **Natural Gas**

 Disadvantage: Pollute the environment, cause global warming, will eventually run out.

#### Importance of saving energy

Fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas will run out soon. Scientists are looking at alternative sources of energy like ocean waves, tides, heat from inside the Earth and so on. However, some of these are not only expensive but also difficult to generate electricity from. For all these reasons, it is important to save energy in our daily lives.

---

### **4.5 Transformation of Energy**

Energy can change from one form to another. This is why it is so useful.

#### **1. Fan: Electrical → Mechanical (rotation of blades)**

* When you switch on a fan, electricity flows into its motor.
* The motor converts **electrical energy** into **mechanical energy**.
* This mechanical energy makes the blades rotate, and moving blades push air, giving us wind.

#### **2. Bulb: Electrical → Light + Heat**

* When electricity passes through the filament (in old bulbs) or special materials (in LED bulbs), it glows.
* The bulb changes **electrical energy** into **light energy**, so we can see.
* Some of the energy also becomes **heat energy** (that’s why bulbs feel hot when touched).

---

### **4.6 Law of Conservation of Energy**

One of the most important laws in physics is:

**Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only change from one form to another. The total energy in the universe always remains constant.**

Example:

* When you eat food (chemical energy), your body uses it for movement (mechanical energy) and heat (thermal energy).
* Energy changes form, but nothing is lost.

---

### **4.7 Energy in Living Things**

Life depends on energy.

* **Plants:** Use solar energy to prepare food (photosynthesis).
* **Animals and Humans:** Eat food to get chemical energy, which powers movement, growth, and repair.
* **Ecosystem:** Energy flows from the Sun → plants → animals → humans.

Without energy, life cannot exist.

---
### **4.9 Importance of Energy in Human Civilization**

Energy is the backbone of modern life:

* **Transport:** Cars, trains, planes, ships.
* **Industry:** Machines, factories, production lines.
* **Communication:** Computers, mobile phones, internet.
* **Healthcare:** Hospitals, surgical equipment, life-support systems.
* **Home:** Cooking, heating, cooling, lighting.

Without energy, society would come to a stop.

# **Section 5: Applications of Force, Work, and Energy**

---

### **5.1 Friction – Helpful and Harmful**

#### **5.1.1 What is Friction?**

Friction is the force that resists motion when two surfaces rub against each other.

#### **5.1.2 Advantages of Friction**

* Helps us walk without slipping.
* Helps vehicles move (tyres grip the road).
* Helps us hold objects firmly.
* Allows nails and screws to stay fixed.

#### **5.1.3 Disadvantages of Friction**

* Causes wear and tear of shoes, tyres, machines.
* Produces unwanted heat (machines get hot).
* Wastes energy by resisting motion.

#### **5.1.4 Reducing Friction**

* Apply **lubricants** like oil or grease.
* Use **ball bearings** in machines.
* Use smooth surfaces.

 Friction can never be completely removed, but it can be controlled.

---

### **5.2 Gravity – The Invisible Pull**

Gravity is one of the most important forces in nature.

* It pulls everything towards the Earth.
* It keeps planets in orbit around the Sun.
* It helps rivers flow, rain fall, and objects stay grounded.

**Examples of Gravity in Action:**

* Dropping a pen—falls straight down.
* Jumping—always land back on the ground.
* Waterfall—water flows downwards due to gravity.

 Without gravity, life on Earth would be impossible; we would float away into space.

---

### **5.3 Simple Machines – Making Work Easier**

Machines are tools that make work easier by reducing effort or changing the direction of force.

#### **5.3.1 Types of Simple Machines**

  1. **Lever:**

    * A rigid bar that rotates around a fixed point (fulcrum).
    * Examples: See-saw, crowbar, scissors.

  2. **Inclined Plane:**

    * A sloping surface used to move heavy loads up or down.
    * Examples: Ramps, slides, staircases.

  3. **Pulley:**

    * A wheel with a rope that changes the direction of force.
    * Examples: Drawing water from a well, cranes.

  4. **Wedge:**

    * A device with a sharp edge that splits things apart.
    * Examples: Knife, axe, nail.

  5. **Screw:**

    * An inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.
    * Examples: Bottle caps, drill bits.

  6. **Wheel and Axle:**

    * A wheel attached to a rod that makes rolling easier.
    * Examples: Cars, bicycles, rolling carts.

#### **5.3.2 Why are Simple Machines Important?**

* Reduce effort.
* Save time.
* Help us do work that would be otherwise impossible.
