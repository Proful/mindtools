#  Matter and Materials

---

## **Section 1: Introduction to Matter**


Matter is one of the most fundamental concepts in science. Everything we see, touch, smell, or use in our everyday lives is made of matter. From the chair you sit on, the clothes you wear, the food you eat, to the air you breathe—all of these are different forms of matter. Even living things, such as plants and animals, are made of matter.

### **What is Matter?**

Matter is defined as *anything that has mass and occupies space (volume).* This means that if something can be weighed and it takes up space, it is matter. For example:

* A stone has weight (mass) and takes up space—it is matter.
* Air, although invisible, also has weight and takes up space—it is matter.
* A drop of water has weight and volume—it is matter.

On the other hand, concepts like **time, energy, or thoughts** are not matter because they do not have mass or occupy space.

### **Modern Scientific View**

Today, scientists know that matter is made up of tiny particles called **atoms.** These atoms combine to form **molecules,** which then form the substances we see. For example:

* A molecule of water (H₂O) is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
* Table salt (NaCl) is made of sodium and chlorine atoms.

Understanding atoms and molecules helps scientists explain why different materials behave differently—for example, why metals conduct electricity, or why wood floats on water.

## **Section 2: Fundamental Properties of Matter**


Matter is not just “stuff.” It has specific **properties** that can be measured, compared, and studied. These properties help scientists and engineers choose the right materials for different purposes.

### **2.1 Mass**

Mass is the amount of matter in an object.

* It is measured using a balance or scale.
* The SI unit of mass is **kilogram (kg).**

Examples:

* A bag of rice may have a mass of 10 kg.
* Your school bag may have a mass of 3 kg.
* Even a tiny grain of sand has mass, although it is very small.

Mass is different from **weight**. Mass is the same everywhere in the universe, but weight changes depending on gravity.

### **2.2 Volume**

Volume is the amount of space matter occupies.

* Liquids are measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL).
* Solids can be measured in cubic centimeters (cm³) or cubic meters (m³).

Examples:

* A water bottle may hold 1 liter of water.
* A small box may have a volume of 200 cm³.
* Even gases like oxygen and nitrogen occupy space (this is why a balloon expands when filled with air).

### **2.3 Density**

Density is the mass of matter per unit volume.
It can be calculated as:

Density = Mass / Volume

Examples:

* A piece of iron feels heavier than a piece of wood of the same size because iron has higher density.
* Ice floats on water because ice has lower density than liquid water.

Density is a very important property used in designing ships, submarines, and even airplanes.

### **2.4 Weight**

Weight is the **force of gravity** acting on the mass of an object.

* It is measured in newtons (N).
* Formula:

Weight = Mass * Gravity

For example:

* On Earth, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 9.8 N.
* On the Moon, the same 1 kg mass weighs less because the Moon’s gravity is weaker.

This shows why astronauts on the Moon can jump higher than on Earth—their weight is less, even though their mass is the same.

### **2.5 Inertia**

Inertia is the property of matter that resists changes in motion.

* A moving ball keeps rolling until friction or another force stops it.
* A book on a table will not move unless you push it.

This property is explained in **Newton’s First Law of Motion,** which states: “An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a force.”

### **2.6 Other General Properties**

* **Shape:** Solids have a definite shape, while liquids and gases do not.
* **Compressibility:** Gases can be compressed easily, but solids and liquids are hard to compress.
* **Visibility:** Some matter (like glass) is transparent, while others (like wood) are opaque.

### **2.7 Importance in Daily Life**

* Density explains why ships float.
* Mass and volume explain why heavy trucks have bigger tires (to distribute weight).
* Inertia explains why you lurch forward when a bus stops suddenly.

---

### Density explains why ships float.

A solid block of metal sinks since it is denser than water, but a ship is built hollow and wide, filled with air spaces. This makes its **average density less than water**, so when placed in water, it pushes water aside (displaces it). The displaced water pushes back with an upward force, which balances the ship’s weight and keeps it floating.

--- 

### Mass and volume explain why heavy trucks have bigger tires (to distribute weight).

Heavy trucks are very heavy because of their large **mass**. When such a heavy vehicle stands on the ground, all that weight presses downward. If the weight is concentrated on a small area, the **pressure** on the ground becomes very high.

To reduce this pressure, trucks are fitted with **big and wide tires**. A large tire has more **surface area** touching the ground. This spreads the truck’s weight over a bigger area, which lowers the pressure on each part of the ground.

That is why trucks do not sink into soft soil or damage the road easily. 

--- 

###  **Situation in a Moving Bus**

* When the bus is moving at a constant speed, **you and the bus are both moving forward at the same velocity**.
* Your whole body and the bus share the same motion.
* The bus is brought to rest by the **braking force** applied on its wheels.
* The **part of your body in contact with the bus** (your feet, lower body on the seat, or hand if holding a rod) stops **along with the bus**.
* But the **upper part of your body is not directly connected to the bus**. Because of inertia, it **keeps moving forward** at the same speed the bus had before stopping.
* As a result, your upper body **lurches or leans forward**.
* Very soon, other forces (friction between you and the seat, muscles in your body, or if you hold a support/handle) **pull your upper body back** and bring it to rest.
* But for a brief moment, you feel that **jerk forward**.

## **Section 3: States of Matter**

All matter in the universe exists in different **states** depending on how its particles are arranged and how much energy they have. The most common states of matter we see in daily life are **solid, liquid, and gas.** Scientists have also discovered other states such as **plasma** and **Bose-Einstein condensate.**

---

### **3.1 Solids**

* **Definition:** Solids have a **definite shape and definite volume.**
* **Particle Arrangement:** The particles are packed very closely together in a fixed arrangement. They cannot move freely but vibrate in place.

**Properties of Solids:**

* They are rigid and hard (stone, wood).
* They cannot be compressed easily.
* They do not flow.
* They have high density compared to liquids and gases.

**Examples in daily life:**

* Ice cubes, wooden chairs, steel spoons, glass marbles, and books.

---

### **3.2 Liquids**

* **Definition:** Liquids have a **definite volume but no definite shape.** They take the shape of their container.
* **Particle Arrangement:** The particles are less tightly packed than in solids. They can move and slide past each other, which makes liquids flow.

**Properties of Liquids:**

* They can be poured.
* They cannot be compressed easily.
* They have surface tension (water droplets form spheres).
* They flow from higher to lower levels.

**Examples in daily life:**

* Water, milk, juice, oil, honey.

---

### Due to surface tension water droplets form spheres

**Surface tension** is the property of a liquid surface that makes it behave like a **stretched elastic sheet**.

* Inside the liquid: Each molecule is surrounded by other molecules from all sides. The attractive forces cancel out → net force is zero.
* On the surface: Molecules do not have neighbors above them, so they are **pulled inward** by the molecules below and sideways.
* This imbalance creates a **contracting force on the surface**, making the liquid surface act like a stretched membrane.
* Water molecules are strongly attracted to each other due to **cohesion**
* For a given volume, a **sphere has the least possible surface area** compared to any other shape (cube, cylinder, irregular shape, etc.).
* Since liquids “want” to minimize surface area, **surface tension pulls the droplet into a spherical shape**.
* Soap bubbles are spherical for the same reason (though they enclose air instead of liquid).

---

### **3.3 Gases**

* **Definition:** Gases have **no definite shape and no definite volume.** They expand to fill any container.
* **Particle Arrangement:** The particles are far apart and move freely at very high speeds.

**Properties of Gases:**

* They can be compressed easily (air in a balloon).
* They expand to occupy all available space.
* They are usually invisible to the eye.
* They mix completely with other gases (oxygen and nitrogen in the air).

**Examples in daily life:**

* Oxygen, carbon dioxide, steam, natural gas, LPG.

---

### **Why gases expand to occupy all available space?**

### 1. **Nature of gas molecules**

* Gas molecules are **very far apart** compared to solids and liquids.
* The forces of attraction between them are **negligible**.
* They move in **all directions randomly** with high speed.

### 2. **Kinetic molecular theory**

* According to this theory, gas particles are in **constant, rapid motion**.
* They collide with each other and with the walls of the container.

### 3. **Effect of container size**

* If the container is small → molecules keep hitting the walls frequently → gas fills the space.
* If the container is large → molecules spread out, but still move until they occupy **all corners** of the container.

### 4. **Reason they occupy all available space**

* Since there are **no strong attractive forces** pulling them together, nothing prevents gas molecules from spreading.
* Their **kinetic energy + random motion** makes them distribute evenly everywhere.

---

### **Examples in daily life**

* **Perfume smell spreads** across the room because gas molecules diffuse until the whole room is filled.
* **Air in a balloon** expands uniformly to fill the balloon’s shape.
* **Cooking gas leak** spreads to every corner of the kitchen.

Gases expand to fill all available space because their particles move freely and rapidly in all directions, with almost no attraction between them.

---

### **Meaning of Diffusion**

**Diffusion** is the natural process by which particles (atoms or molecules) move from a region of **high concentration** to a region of **low concentration**, until they are **evenly spread out**.

So when we say **"gas molecules diffuse,"** it means:

* Gas molecules move **randomly** in all directions.
* They gradually **spread out and mix** with other gas molecules without needing stirring or shaking.

### **Why Does Diffusion Happen in Gases?**

* Gas molecules are **far apart** and have **weak intermolecular forces**.
* They are in **constant, rapid motion** due to kinetic energy.
* When they collide with each other, they bounce and change direction → over time they **spread throughout the container**.

**Examples:**

* **Perfume or deodorant** → When sprayed in one corner of a room, the smell reaches everyone because gas molecules diffuse through the air.
* **Cooking gas leak** → The LPG spreads throughout the kitchen.
* **Oxygen and carbon dioxide in lungs** → In alveoli, oxygen diffuses from air into blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses from blood into air.

---

### **3.4 Plasma (Advanced Knowledge)**

* Plasma is sometimes called the **fourth state of matter.**
* It consists of gas-like particles that are electrically charged.
* Plasma is found in **stars, lightning, neon signs, and fluorescent lamps.**
* It is the most common state of matter in the universe (most of the Sun and stars are made of plasma).

"Plasma screen" is a display that works by exciting gases to produce light, but it was used in TVs, not in mobile phones. Modern mobiles use LCD or OLED, which are more efficient and compact.

---

### **3.5 Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)**

* This is called the **fifth state of matter.**
* It was discovered by Indian scientist **Satyendra Nath Bose** and **Albert Einstein.**
* It occurs at extremely low temperatures close to **absolute zero (-273°C).**
* At this point, particles behave as one single “super-particle.”

---

## **Section 4: Changes in States of Matter**

Matter can change from one state to another when **heat energy** is added or removed. These changes are usually **physical changes** (they can be reversed).

---

### **4.1 Melting**

* **Definition:** Change from **solid to liquid.**
* **Process:** When a solid is heated, its particles gain energy and start vibrating faster. At a certain temperature (melting point), they break free from fixed positions.

**Examples:**

  * Ice melting into water.
  * Butter melting on a hot pan.
  * Wax melting when a candle burns.

---

### **4.2 Freezing**

* **Definition:** Change from **liquid to solid.**
* **Process:** When a liquid is cooled, particles lose energy and settle into fixed positions.

**Examples:**

  * Water freezing into ice.
  * Juice turning into ice popsicles in the freezer.

---

### **4.3 Evaporation**

* **Definition:** Change from **liquid to gas** without boiling.
* **Process:** Happens at the surface of a liquid at any temperature. Faster when heat, airflow, or surface area increases.

**Examples:**

  * Wet clothes drying in the sun.
  * Sweat evaporating to cool our body.

---

### **4.4 Boiling**

* **Definition:** Rapid change from **liquid to gas** throughout the liquid at a fixed temperature (boiling point).

**Examples:**

  * Water boiling at 100°C to form steam.
  * Milk boiling and forming bubbles.

---

### **4.5 Condensation**

* **Definition:** Change from **gas to liquid.**
* **Process:** When gas cools, particles lose energy and come closer together.

**Examples:**

  * Water droplets forming on the outside of a cold glass.
  * Clouds forming when water vapor condenses.

---

### **4.6 Sublimation**

* **Definition:** Change from **solid directly to gas** without becoming liquid.

**Examples:**

* Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) turning into carbon dioxide gas.
* Snow in very cold, dry regions (like the Himalayas or Antarctica) → snow and ice can slowly change into water vapor without melting.
* Frost on cold mornings → sometimes disappears directly into vapor when sunlight hits.
* Glaciers → in very dry, cold air, ice sublimates directly into water vapor.

---

### **4.7 Deposition**

* **Definition:** Change from **gas directly to solid.**

**Examples:**

  * Frost forming on leaves in winter.
  * Ice crystals forming on windows.

---

## **Section 5: Materials – Natural and Synthetic**

Materials are the substances from which objects are made. Every object around us—whether it’s a table, a glass, or a shirt—is made from some material. These materials can be broadly divided into **natural materials** (found in nature) and **synthetic materials** (made by humans in factories).

---

### **5.1 Natural Materials**

---

## **Section 7: Mixtures and Solutions**

### **What is a Mixture?**

A **mixture** is formed when two or more substances are physically combined but not chemically bonded.

* Example: Sand and salt, air (mixture of gases), fruit salad.

**Characteristics of mixtures:**

* Components keep their individual properties.
* Can usually be separated by physical methods (like filtration, evaporation, or using magnets).
* Do not have fixed proportions (you can mix in different amounts).

---

### **Types of Mixtures**

#### 1. **Homogeneous mixture:** Uniform throughout, cannot see different parts.

  * Example: Salt dissolved in water, air.

#### 2. **Heterogeneous mixture:** Non-uniform, different parts are visible.

  * Example: Oil and water, sand and iron filings.

---

### **What is a Solution?**

A **solution** is a special type of homogeneous mixture where one substance dissolves in another.

* **Solute:** The substance that gets dissolved. (Salt in salt water)
* **Solvent:** The substance that dissolves the solute. (Water in salt water)
* **Solution:** The final uniform mixture.

**Examples:** Sugar in tea, carbon dioxide in soda water.

---

### **Factors Affecting Solubility**

1. **Temperature:** Higher temperature usually increases solubility of solids in liquids. **Example**: Sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than cold water.

2. **Stirring:** Helps distribute solute particles quickly.

3. **Particle size:** Smaller particles dissolve faster.

4. **Nature of solute and solvent:** “Like dissolves like” – Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents.

---

### **Methods of Separating Mixtures**

* **Filtration:** To separate solids from liquids (sand and water).
* **Evaporation:** To get solute from solution (salt from seawater).
* **Magnetic separation:** To separate iron from sand.
* **Distillation:** To separate liquids with different boiling points (alcohol and water).
* **Chromatography:** To separate colors in ink.

---

## **Section 8: Atoms, Molecules, and Elements**

To truly understand matter, we must look deeper at what it is made of: **atoms and molecules**.

---

### **What is an Atom?**

* The smallest unit of matter that cannot be divided further by chemical means.
* Every material in the universe is made of atoms.
* Example: A gold atom is the smallest part of gold that is still gold.

Atoms are like the **building blocks** of matter, just like bricks in a house.

---

### **Structure of an Atom**

* **Nucleus:** Center of the atom, contains protons (+ charge) and neutrons (no charge).
* **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles that move around the nucleus in shells.

An atom is mostly empty space, but the arrangement of electrons determines how it reacts with other atoms.

---

### **What is a Molecule?**

A **molecule** is formed when two or more atoms join together chemically.

* Example: Oxygen gas (O₂) has 2 oxygen atoms.
* Water (H₂O) has 2 hydrogen atoms + 1 oxygen atom.

Molecules can be made of the same element (O₂) or different elements (H₂O).

---

### **Elements and Compounds**

* **Element:** Pure substance made of only one type of atom. (Gold, Oxygen, Iron)
* **Compound:** Substance made of two or more elements chemically combined. (Water, Carbon dioxide, Salt)

**Difference:**

* Salt (NaCl) is a compound – its properties are different from sodium (metal) and chlorine (toxic gas).
* Iron (Fe) is an element – it cannot be broken into simpler substances by chemical methods.

---

### **Periodic Table of Elements**

* Scientists have discovered over 118 elements.
* The **Periodic Table** arranges them according to their properties.
* Metals, non-metals, and noble gases are grouped for easier understanding.

---

### **Importance of Atoms and Molecules**

* Explain why materials behave differently (gold is shiny, wood burns, iron rusts).
* Help in making new materials (plastic, medicines).
* Fundamental to understanding chemistry.


---

## **Section 9: Heat and Materials**

Heat plays a very important role in how materials behave. Some materials allow heat to pass through easily, while others do not.

---

### **What is Heat?**

* Heat is a form of energy that makes things warm.
* It always flows from a hotter object to a colder one.
* Example: A hot spoon placed in cold water transfers heat to the water.

---

### **Conductors and Insulators**

#### 1. **Conductors of Heat**

   * Substances that allow heat to pass through them easily.
   * Metals like iron, copper, aluminum are good conductors.
   * That is why cooking pans are made of metal.

#### 2. **Insulators of Heat**

   * Substances that do not allow heat to pass easily.
   * Wood, plastic, rubber, and wool are insulators.
   * That is why cooking pans have plastic or wooden handles.

---

### **Expansion and Contraction of Materials**

When materials are heated:

* They **expand** (become larger).
* When cooled, they **contract** (become smaller).

**Examples:**

* Railway tracks have gaps to allow expansion in hot weather.
* Electric wires sag in summer (expansion) and tighten in winter (contraction).

---

### **Change of State by Heat**

Heat can change the state of matter:

* Solid → Liquid (melting)
* Liquid → Gas (evaporation/boiling)
* Gas → Liquid (condensation)
* Liquid → Solid (freezing)

Example: Ice melts into water, water boils to steam, and steam condenses back to water.

---

## **Section 10: Electricity and Materials**

Just like heat, electricity also interacts with materials differently.

---

### **Conductors and Insulators of Electricity**

#### 1. **Conductors:** Materials that allow electric current to pass.

   * Examples: Metals (copper, aluminum, silver).
   * Used in wires and circuits.

#### 2. **Insulators:** Materials that block electric current.

   * Examples: Rubber, plastic, glass, wood.
   * Used in switches, coverings, plugs for safety.

---

### **Importance of Conductors and Insulators**

* Electric wires are made of copper (conductor) covered in plastic (insulator).
* Switches use plastic casing to prevent shocks.
* Circuit boards use metals to carry electricity.
