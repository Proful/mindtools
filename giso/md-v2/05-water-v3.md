---

## **Section 1: Introduction to Water**

Water covers about **71% of Earth’s surface**. Most of this water (around 97%) is found in oceans and seas and is salty. Only about **3% is fresh water**, and out of that, less than 1% is available for humans, animals, and plants to use.

---

## **Section 2: Physical and Chemical Properties of Water**

### **Physical Properties**

  1. **State of Matter** – Water exists naturally in three states:

    * **Solid**: Ice, snow, glaciers.
    * **Liquid**: Rivers, lakes, seas, groundwater.
    * **Gas**: Water vapor in the air.
      This ability to exist in all three states makes water unique.

  2. **Boiling Point and Freezing Point** –

    * Freezes at **0°C** into ice.
    * Boils at **100°C** at sea level into steam.
    * These values change slightly with pressure (for example, water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes).

  3. **Color, Taste, and Odor** – Pure water is **colorless, tasteless, and odorless**, though in nature it often contains minerals and dissolved gases that give it slight variations.

  4. **Density and Ice’s Peculiar Property** – Water is heaviest at 4°C. Ice is less dense than liquid water, so it floats. This is crucial for aquatic life because ice forms at the top of lakes and rivers, insulating the water below and allowing organisms to survive in cold climates.

  5. **Universal Solvent** – Water dissolves more substances than any other liquid, earning it the title of **“Universal Solvent.”** This property allows nutrients and minerals to be transported in living organisms.

---

### **Chemical Properties**

  1. **Molecular Formula** – Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H₂O).
  2. **Polarity** – Water molecules are polar, meaning one end is slightly positive and the other slightly negative. This makes water excellent at dissolving salts, sugars, and many gases.
  3. **pH Level** – Pure water has a pH of **7**, making it neutral.
  4. **Reactivity** – Water reacts with many substances, for example:

    * With metals like sodium → producing hydrogen gas.
    * With carbon dioxide → forming carbonic acid.

## **Section 3: Sources of Water**

### **Natural Sources**

* **Rainwater** – Freshwater supplied by the water cycle.
* **Rivers and Streams** – Flowing bodies of freshwater.
* **Lakes and Ponds** – Standing bodies of freshwater.
* **Groundwater** – Stored in aquifers underground.
* **Glaciers and Icecaps** – Storehouse of the majority of Earth’s freshwater.
* **Oceans and Seas** – Largest water bodies, but salty.

### **Human-Made Sources**

* **Wells and Tube Wells** – Access groundwater.
* **Dams and Reservoirs** – Store water for drinking, irrigation, and electricity.
* **Canals** – Artificial waterways for irrigation and transport.
* **Desalination Plants** – Convert seawater into usable freshwater.

## **Section 4: The Water Cycle**

The **water cycle (hydrological cycle)** describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth’s surface.

### Steps in the Water Cycle:

1. **Evaporation** – Sun heats water bodies, changing liquid water into vapor.
2. **Transpiration** – Plants release water vapor through their leaves.
3. **Condensation** – Water vapor cools to form clouds.
4. **Precipitation** – Clouds release water as rain, snow, hail, or sleet.
5. **Infiltration and Runoff** – Water seeps into the ground (groundwater) or flows back into rivers and oceans.

This cycle ensures a **continuous supply of freshwater**. Without it, life would not be sustainable.

--- 

###  **Natural Sources of Water**

These occur in nature without human effort:

* Rain
* Rivers
* Lakes
* Ponds
* Glaciers
* Springs
* Groundwater (underground water stored in aquifers)

###  **Man-made / Artificial Sources of Water**

These are ways humans bring natural water for use:

* **Tap water** → Comes from rivers, lakes, or groundwater but supplied through pipes after treatment.
* **Handpumps** → Bring up **groundwater** (natural) using a manually operated pump.
* **Wells** → Dug by humans to access **groundwater** (natural).

 So, the water in wells and handpumps is **natural (groundwater)**, but the structure to get it is **man-made**.
 Tap water is also natural in origin, but heavily managed, purified, and distributed by humans.

##  Floating Ability of Substances in Water

### **Density and Floating**

* **Density = Mass ÷ Volume**
* Water also has its own density.
* Water has a density of about **1 g/cm³**.
* **Density** means how tightly matter is packed in an object.
* If an object is **lighter for its size** than water → it floats.
* If an object is **heavier for its size** than water → it sinks.

**Example:**

* Wood floats (less dense than water).
* Stone sinks (more dense than water).
* A small steel nail is very heavy for its small size → it sinks.
* A huge ship is hollow inside, so it has a lot of air.
* This makes the whole ship lighter for its size → it floats.

--- 

###  Why Do Objects Float on Water?

* Because of the **balance between weight and buoyant force**.
* If an object can push away (displace) enough water to balance its own weight → it floats.
* Shape and hollow design (like boats, ships, tubes) help in floating even if the material itself is heavy.

--- 

### **Hollow Steel Container in Water**

  * A **solid steel block** sinks (because steel is denser than water).
  * A **hollow steel container (like a ship)** floats because:

    * Its **large hollow shape traps air**, increasing its total volume.
    * This reduces its **average density** (steel + air together).
    * Now its average density is **less than water**, so it floats.

That’s why **ships made of heavy steel can float**, while a small steel nail sinks.

A **hollow steel container** can either **float** or **sink** in a water-filled tube depending on **how heavy it is for the space it takes up** (its overall or “average” density). If that overall heaviness is **less than water**, it floats. If it’s **more**, it sinks.

---

### **Tube Filled with Water and Floating Objects**

* If you place a hollow ball (like a plastic ball) in a water-filled tube → it floats at the top because it’s less dense.
* If you place a stone → it sinks to the bottom.
* If you place a sealed empty bottle → it floats because air inside lowers the average density.

---

### What “hollow” means here

* The steel shell is heavy, but the inside is usually filled with **air**, which is very light.
* When you consider the whole thing (steel + the air space), the object may be **light for its size** — that’s why many big steel things (ships) float even though steel itself is heavy.

---

### Scenarios you’ll see in a water-filled tube

#### 1. **Sealed hollow container (air inside)**

   * The container is mostly air inside the steel walls.
   * The whole package (steel + air) is **not very heavy for how big it is**, so it **floats** — it will sit partly above the water and partly below, depending on how “light for its size” it is.

#### 2. **Hollow container with an open top (water can enter)**

   * Water fills the inside. Now the inside is no longer light; the container becomes **much heavier for its size** and usually **sinks**.

#### 3. **Container with a small hole**

   * Water slowly fills the hollow part through the hole. As that happens the container gets heavier and eventually **sinks**.

#### 4. **Partly filled with water**

   * If only some water enters, the container may settle lower in the water but still float — how low depends on how much water is inside (how heavy it is for its size).

#### 5. **Add weight or remove air**

   * Putting extra weight inside (stones, sand) makes it heavier for its size → **sinks**.
   * Trapping more air or making the hollow space bigger makes it lighter for its size → **floats more**.

---

### Effect of the tube (narrow container of water)

  * If the tube is **wide enough**, the hollow steel container will behave like in an open tank: float or sink depending on its average density.
  * If the tube is **very narrow** (container touches the sides):

    * The container might get **stuck** and not move freely.
    * It might not be able to find the position where its heaviness matches the water, so you could see it jammed partly submerged.
  * Putting the object in the tube also **raises the water level** inside the tube (because the object takes up space). If the tube is full, water may spill out.

---

### Everyday, simple examples to try

* An **empty sealed tin can** in a glass of water — it usually floats.
* Punch a small hole in that can — water goes in and the can **sinks**.
* A **steel nail** (solid, no air) always **sinks** because it’s heavy for its tiny size.
* A **large hollow steel drum** with air inside can **float**; fill it with water and it **sinks**.

### Distillation

#### **What it is:** 

A method to separate liquids (or a liquid from dissolved solids) by turning one part into vapor and then turning that vapor back into liquid.

#### **How it works (plain words):** 

You heat the mixture until the more easily vapour-forming part turns into gas. That gas is sent to a cool surface where it becomes liquid again and is collected separately.

#### **Equipment (everyday / lab):** 

A heated flask, a tube or condenser to cool the vapor, and a collecting container.

#### **Common uses / examples:** 

Making pure water from salty water (thermal desalination), separating alcohol from a fermented mash, extracting essential oils.

#### **What it separates:** 

Volatile substance(s) (the ones that vaporize) from less-volatile ones.

#### **Limits / cautions:** 

If two liquids vaporize at nearly the same temperature you need extra equipment (a fractionating column). Some substances break down when heated. Distillation recovers the vapor as liquid — evaporation does not.

---

### Sedimentation

#### **What it is:** 

Letting heavy particles in a liquid settle down naturally under gravity.

#### **How it works:** 

You leave the mixture still. Heavier particles slowly fall and form a layer of sediment at the bottom. After enough time the liquid above becomes clearer.

#### **Equipment / where used:** 

Simple containers, settling tanks in water treatment plants, clarifiers. Centrifuges do the same thing faster by spinning.

#### **Common uses / examples:** 

Clearing muddy water by letting the dirt settle; wastewater treatment; removing sand from water.

#### **What it separates:** 

Solid particles suspended in a liquid (only those that are heavy enough to settle).

#### **Limits / cautions:** 

Very fine or very light particles settle slowly or not at all — may need flocculants or another method afterwards.

---

### Filtration

#### **What it is:** 

Passing a mixture through a porous material to trap solid particles while the liquid (or gas) passes through.

#### **How it works:** 

The porous medium (filter paper, sand, membrane) stops particles larger than its pores; the cleaner liquid flows out.

#### **Types / equipment:** 

Coffee filter or sieve (simple), sand filters, membrane filters, vacuum filters in labs.

#### **Common uses / examples:** 

Making coffee, cleaning pond water, laboratory separations, household water filters.

#### **What it separates:** 

Particles larger than the filter’s pore size (solids from liquids or gases).

#### **Limits / cautions:** 

Filters cannot remove dissolved substances (like salts). Filters can clog and need cleaning or replacement. Choose pore size to match particle size.

---

### Evaporation

#### **What it is:** 

Removing the liquid part by turning it into vapor and letting that vapor escape — leaving behind whatever was dissolved or suspended.

#### **How it works:** 

Heat or exposure to air causes the liquid (often the solvent, like water) to evaporate; the non-volatile material stays and concentrates or crystallizes.

#### **Common uses / examples:** 

Making salt from seawater (sun/heat evaporates water, salt stays), drying clothes, concentrating fruit juices.

#### **What it separates:** 

A volatile liquid (solvent) from nonvolatile dissolved solids.

#### **Difference from distillation:** 

Evaporation removes the solvent and wastes or releases the vapor; distillation captures and condenses the vapor to reuse it.

#### **Limits / cautions:** 

Not suitable if the thing you want to keep is volatile too, or if you need the evaporated liquid back. Can be slow and needs energy (heat).

---

### Decantation

#### **What it is:** 

Carefully pouring off the clear liquid from the top after solids have settled, or separating two immiscible (non-mixing) liquids by pouring.

#### **How it works:** 

Let the mixture settle so layers form (solid at bottom or one liquid on top of another), then tilt and pour the top layer away without disturbing the bottom. A separatory funnel is a more precise tool for liquids.

#### **Common uses / examples:** 

Pouring clear water off settled mud; separating oil from water in a lab using a funnel.

#### **What it separates:** 

Liquid from settled solids, or one liquid layer from another (when they don’t mix).

#### **Limits / cautions:** 

Not perfect — some particles or droplets remain behind. Works best after sedimentation or when layers are clearly formed.

---

### Condensation

#### **What it is:** 

Turning a vapor or gas back into liquid by cooling it.

#### **How it works:** 

Cooling the vapor slows its molecules so they come together and form droplets on a cold surface. Those droplets run off and can be collected.

#### **Common uses / examples:** 

Water forming on a cold glass, steam turning back to water in a distillation condenser, dehumidifiers, cloud/dew formation in nature.

#### **What it separates/does:** 

Collects the vapor form of a substance as liquid — crucial in distillation and in recovering solvents.

#### **Limits / cautions:** 

Requires a cool surface or colder environment; the condensed liquid may still carry impurities if those vapors were mixed.

##  Main Stages of Water Purification

### 1. **Screening (Removal of Large Objects)**

   * Water first passes through metal screens.
   * Removes sticks, leaves, plastic, and other large debris.

### 2. **Aeration (Mixing with Air)** *(in some plants)*

   * Water is sprayed or shaken with air.
   * Helps remove gases (like carbon dioxide), bad smells, and makes oxygen available for the next processes.

### 3. **Coagulation and Flocculation (Clumping of Dirt)**

   * Chemicals like **alum** are added.
   * These chemicals make tiny dirt and clay particles stick together to form bigger lumps called **flocs**.

### 4. **Sedimentation (Settling of Flocs)**

   * The heavy flocs sink to the bottom of a settling tank.
   * Cleaner water remains on top.

### 5. **Filtration (Removing Fine Particles)**

   * Water passes through layers of sand, gravel, and charcoal.
   * Removes fine dust, small particles, and many germs.

### 6. **Disinfection (Killing Germs)**

   * Chemicals (like **chlorine** or ozone) or **UV light** are used.
   * Kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

### 7. **Storage & Distribution**

   * Purified water is stored in clean tanks.
   * Then sent through pipes to homes, schools, and industries.

---

###  Why Alum is Added in Water Treatment

* Natural water (from rivers, lakes) contains **tiny dust, clay, and dirt particles**.
* These particles are so small and light that they **do not settle down easily** in the sedimentation tank.
* **Alum (aluminium sulfate)** is added to solve this problem.

---

###  What Alum Does

* When mixed with water, alum forms a **sticky substance**.
* This sticky substance makes the **tiny particles clump together** into bigger, heavier lumps called **flocs**.
* These flocs are much heavier than individual particles, so they **sink quickly** to the bottom of the sedimentation tank.

---

###  Result

* Water becomes much **clearer** because most of the suspended dirt settles down.
* This process is called **coagulation and flocculation**.
* After this step, filtration and disinfection can remove the remaining fine particles and germs more effectively.

---

##  What is Groundwater?

* Groundwater is the water stored under the earth’s surface in **soil, sand, and rock layers (aquifers)**.
* We use it through **wells, handpumps, tube wells, and borewells**.

---

###  Reasons for Depletion of Underground Water

#### 1. **Overuse for Agriculture**

   * Farmers use tube wells and bore wells to irrigate fields.
   * Continuous pumping of groundwater for crops (like rice, sugarcane that need a lot of water) lowers the water table.

#### 2. **Growing Population**

   * More people → more demand for drinking water, sanitation, and industry.
   * This increases extraction of groundwater.

#### 3. **Urbanization and Industrialization**

   * Cities and factories depend heavily on groundwater.
   * More buildings → less open soil for rainwater to seep down (recharge), so groundwater is not refilled properly.

#### 4. **Deforestation**

   * Trees help rainwater seep into the soil.
   * Cutting trees reduces recharge of groundwater, leading to depletion.

#### 5. **Climate Change & Irregular Rainfall**

   * Less rainfall in some areas reduces the natural refilling of underground water.
   * Long dry seasons mean people extract more groundwater than nature can replace.

#### 6. **Poor Water Management**

   * Leaks, wastage, and no rainwater harvesting.
   * Heavy dependence on groundwater instead of surface water sources (rivers, lakes, reservoirs).

##  Why bubbles form in cold drinks

* Cold drinks contain **carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas** dissolved in the liquid under high pressure.
* When you open the bottle, the pressure is released.
* The dissolved gas escapes and forms tiny **bubbles** inside the liquid.

---

### ⬆️ Why bubbles move upwards

#### 1. **Gas is lighter than liquid**

   * The bubbles are filled with CO₂ gas, which is much lighter than the surrounding drink.
   * Since lighter things rise above heavier things, the bubbles start moving upwards.

#### 2. **Density difference**

   * The drink is dense (heavy for its size).
   * The gas bubble is less dense (light for its size).
   * That difference makes the bubble float upward through the liquid.

#### 3. **Reaching the surface**

   * The bubbles rise until they reach the top surface of the drink.
   * Then they burst and release the gas into the air — this gives the **fizzing sound** and tingly feeling.
