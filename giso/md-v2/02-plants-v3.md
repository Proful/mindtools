## The Science of Botany

The study of plants is called **Botany**. 

Today, botany includes modern branches such as:

- **Plant Physiology** (how plants work internally)
- **Plant Ecology** (interaction with the environment)
- **Plant Genetics** (study of heredity and variation in plants)
- **Plant Pathology** (study of plant diseases)

## Classification Based on Size and Stem

### **Herbs**

* **Definition**: Herbs are small plants that have **soft, green, and tender stems**. Unlike woody plants (like trees or shrubs), herbs do not have thick, hard stems.
* **Life Span**: They usually live for a **short duration**, often only one season or a few months.
* **Size**: Herbs are **small in size** compared to shrubs and trees. They usually grow close to the ground.
* **Uses**: Many herbs are used as food, flavoring, or medicine. Their leaves, stems, or seeds may be edible or medicinal.
* **Growth**: They are **easy to grow in gardens, pots, or fields**, which makes them very common in kitchen gardens.

---

#### **Examples of Herbs**

* **Mint (Pudina)** – Used for flavoring food, making chutney, tea, etc.
* **Coriander (Dhania)** – Leaves used as garnish and seeds as spice.
* **Spinach (Palak)** – A leafy vegetable rich in iron.
* **Tulsi (Holy Basil)** – Considered sacred in India; used in medicines and herbal teas.
* **Wheat, Paddy, Mustard** – These are also herbs, grown on a larger scale as crops.

---

### **Shrubs**

  * **Definition**: Shrubs are **medium-sized, woody plants** that are bushy in nature. They are **smaller than trees but bigger than herbs**.
  * **Stem**: The stems are **hard and woody** but **not very thick** like trees.
  * **Branches**: They usually have **many branches that arise from near the ground**, making them look dense and bushy.
  * **Life Span**: Shrubs can live for **several years**, longer than herbs but shorter than many trees.
  * **Size**: They are **medium in height**, generally between herbs and trees.
  * **Uses**:

    * Provide **flowers** (rose, hibiscus)
    * Give **fruits** (lemon, pomegranate)
    * Some are used for **fibers** (cotton)
    * Many are **ornamental** (decorative plants in gardens)

---

#### **Examples of Shrubs**

---

### **Trees**

  * **Definition**: Trees are **tall, big plants** with a strong, thick, woody trunk. They are the largest among all types of plants.
  * **Stem/Trunk**: The main stem is called the **trunk**. It is **thick, hard, and woody**, growing upright and supporting many branches.
  * **Branches**: Branches usually arise from the **upper part of the trunk**, forming a canopy (crown) of leaves.
  * **Life Span**: Trees can live for **many years**, some even for **hundreds or thousands of years** (like the Banyan or Oak).
  * **Size**: They are **much taller and larger** than shrubs and herbs.
  * **Uses**:

    * Provide **shade** and cool the environment.
    * Give **fruits** (mango, coconut, apple).
    * Supply **wood** for furniture, houses, and fuel.
    * Produce **oxygen**, making air fresh and clean.
    * Many are used in **medicine** (like neem).
    * Prevent **soil erosion** and support wildlife.

---

![trees](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-03-trees.jpg)

---

### **Climbers**

  * **Definition**: Climbers are plants that have **weak, soft, and flexible stems**. Because their stems cannot support the weight of the plant, they **cannot stand straight on their own**.
  * **Growth**: To grow upwards, climbers need **support** such as sticks, walls, fences, or other plants. They climb by using **tendrils, twining stems, hooks, or aerial roots**.
  * **Stem**: Very thin and delicate, not strong enough to hold the plant upright.
  * **Size**: Can grow to a **great length** if proper support is provided.
  * **Uses**:

    * Many climbers provide **fruits** (like grapevine, pea, bean).
    * Some are **ornamental plants** (like money plant).
    * Certain climbers are grown for **medicinal purposes**.

---

#### **Examples of Climbers**

* **Money Plant** – A popular houseplant, also considered lucky.
* **Pea Plant** – Produces peas, uses tendrils to climb.
* **Grapevine** – Grown for grapes, climbs with the help of tendrils.
* **Bean Plant** – Uses twining stems to climb supports.
* **Passionflower** – An ornamental and medicinal climber.

---

### **Creepers**

  * **Definition**: Creepers are plants with **weak, delicate stems** that cannot grow upright. Instead of climbing, they **spread and grow along the ground**.
  * **Stem**: Very soft and fragile, unable to support heavy fruits above the ground.
  * **Growth**: They grow **horizontally** on the soil surface, covering the ground.
  * **Fruits**: Creepers usually bear **large, fleshy fruits** that grow on or close to the ground.
  * **Uses**:

    * Many creepers are **vegetable crops** (pumpkin, bottle gourd).
    * Some give **juicy fruits** (watermelon, muskmelon).
    * They are often grown in **fields and gardens** for food.

---

#### **Examples of Creepers**

* **Pumpkin** – Produces large fruits, widely used as a vegetable.
* **Watermelon** – Juicy summer fruit growing on ground vines.
* **Bottle Gourd (Lauki)** – A vegetable creeper with long, light-green fruits.
* **Muskmelon (Kharbooja)** – Sweet, aromatic fruit-bearing creeper.

## Classification Based on Life Cycle

Plants can also be grouped by how long they live.

  1. **Annuals** – Live for **one season/year**

    - Grow, flower, produce seeds, and die within a year
    - Examples: Wheat, rice, sunflower

  2. **Biennials** – Live for **two years**

    - First year: Grow roots, stems, and leaves
    - Second year: Flower and produce seeds
    - Examples: Carrot, beetroot, cabbage

  3. **Perennials** – Live for **many years**

    - Usually woody plants like trees
    - Examples: Mango, banyan, neem, teak

## Scientific Classification

For higher-level understanding, plants are divided into two major groups:

### Non-Flowering Plants (Cryptogams)

Do not produce flowers or seeds, reproduce by **spores**

#### **Algae** (meaning *seaweed*)

  * **What they are**: Very simple plants found mostly in **water** (ponds, lakes, rivers, seas).
  * **Features**:

    * Do not have true roots, stems, or leaves.
    * Green, red, or brown in color because of different pigments.
    * Make their own food by photosynthesis.

#### **Gymnosperms**

*(Gymnosperm = from Greek “gymnos” = naked, “sperma” = seed → plants with naked seeds)*

  * **What they are**: Plants whose **seeds are not enclosed in fruits**. The seeds are usually found exposed on the surface of cones.
  * **Features**:

    * Do not have flowers.

---

#### **Angiosperms**

*(Angiosperm = from Greek “angio” = covered, “sperma” = seed → plants with covered seeds)*

  * **What they are**: Plants whose **seeds are enclosed inside a fruit**. These are the most **common and diverse group of plants** on Earth.
  * **Features**:

    * Have **flowers** (flowering plants).

---

## External Structure of a Plant

The external structure can be divided into **two main systems**:

---

## (A) The Root System

Roots are an important part of a plant. They usually grow **underground** and help the plant stay fixed in the soil.

### **Functions of Roots**

1. **Anchorage** – Roots fix the plant firmly into the soil so that it does not get blown away by wind or washed away by rain.
2. **Absorption** – Tiny root hairs absorb **water and minerals** from the soil, which are then carried to other parts of the plant.
3. **Storage of food** – In some plants, roots store extra food prepared by leaves (e.g., carrot, radish, beetroot, turnip, sweet potato).
4. **Prevent soil erosion** – Roots bind the soil particles together and stop them from being carried away by wind or water.
5. **Additional functions** – In some plants, roots are modified to give support, breathe air, or perform other special tasks.

---

### **Types of Root Systems**

#### 1. **Taproot System**

* A **single, main root** grows deep into the soil.
* Many **small side roots** (called lateral roots) grow from it.
* Common in **dicot plants** (plants with two cotyledons).
* **Examples**: Carrot, Mango, Mustard, Radish, Beetroot, Pea.

#### 2. **Fibrous Root System**

* No single main root. Instead, **many thin roots** grow together from the base of the stem.
* Roots spread out in the soil, forming a thick network.
* Common in **monocot plants** (plants with one cotyledon).
* **Examples**: Grass, Wheat, Rice, Onion, Maize.

---

### **Special Roots (Modified Roots)**

Some roots are modified to do special jobs apart from the usual functions.

  1. **Prop roots**

    * Found in **banyan trees**.
    * Roots grow downward from branches into the soil, like pillars.
    * Provide **extra support** to the huge tree.

  2. **Breathing roots (pneumatophores)**

    * Found in **mangrove trees** that grow in swamps (waterlogged areas).
    * Roots come out of the soil and grow upward.
    * Help the plant **take in oxygen from the air**, since swampy soil lacks air.

  3. **Storage roots**

    * Roots become swollen to store extra food.
    * These are eaten as vegetables.
    * **Examples**: Carrot, Turnip, Beetroot, Sweet Potato, Tapioca.

  4. **Climbing roots**

    * In some climbers, roots come out from nodes and help the plant **attach to walls or supports**.
    * **Examples**: Betel, Ivy, Black Pepper.

  5. **Parasitic roots**

    * Found in parasitic plants that depend on other plants for food.
    * Special roots called **haustoria** penetrate into the host plant to suck nutrients.
    * **Examples**: Cuscuta (amarbel), Mistletoe.

---

## (B) The Shoot System

The **shoot system** includes all the parts of a plant that grow **above the ground**. These parts work together to help the plant make food, reproduce, and survive. The main parts are **stem, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds**.

---

### **Stem**

  * **Support**: The stem **holds and supports** the plant upright. It bears leaves, flowers, and fruits.
  * **Transport**:

    * Carries **water and minerals** from the roots to leaves through xylem.
    * Carries **prepared food** from leaves to other parts through phloem.
  * **Storage**: In some plants, stems store food and water.

    * **Examples**: Sugarcane (sugar), Potato (starch), Ginger and Onion (modified underground stems).
  * **Special Functions**:

    * Some stems like cactus stems are green and perform **photosynthesis** (since cactus leaves are reduced to spines).
    * Some stems (like in grapevine) help the plant **climb**.

---

### **Leaves**

Leaves are called the **“kitchen of the plant”** because they prepare food by the process of **photosynthesis**.

* **Color**: Leaves are **green** due to a pigment called **chlorophyll**.
* **Shape**: Usually flat and broad to capture maximum sunlight.
* **Stomata**: Tiny pores present on the surface of leaves. They allow **exchange of gases** (carbon dioxide in, oxygen out) and water vapor (transpiration).
* **Veins**: Network of thin lines in a leaf that transport water and food.

#### Types of Leaves:

  1. **Simple leaf** – One single blade.

    * Examples: Mango, Guava, Banana.
  2. **Compound leaf** – Leaf divided into many small leaflets.

    * Examples: Neem, Rose, Pea.

#### Functions of Leaves:

* Prepare food by photosynthesis.
* Allow gas exchange.
* Help in **transpiration** (loss of water vapor from stomata, which cools the plant).
* Sometimes store food (e.g., onion leaves, cabbage).

---

### **Flower**

Flowers are the **reproductive organs** of a plant. They help plants in making seeds and fruits.

#### Parts of a Flower:

  * **Petals**: Brightly colored, attract insects and birds for pollination.
  * **Sepals**: Small green parts that **protect the bud** before it blooms.
  * **Stamens (male part)**:

    * **Anther** – produces pollen grains (male gametes).
    * **Filament** – holds the anther.
  * **Carpel/Pistil (female part)**:

    * **Stigma** – sticky top part to catch pollen.
    * **Style** – tube-like structure.
    * **Ovary** – contains ovules (female gametes). After fertilization, ovary develops into fruit.

#### Importance of Flowers:

* Help in **reproduction** (make seeds and fruits).
* Attract **pollinators** like bees, butterflies, and birds.
* Some are **edible**: Broccoli, Cauliflower, Banana flower.
* Provide **fragrance and beauty**, used in perfumes and decoration.

---

### **Fruits and Seeds**

After fertilization in flowers, the **ovary develops into a fruit** and the **ovules develop into seeds**.

#### Fruits:

* Protect seeds inside them.
* Store food and help in seed dispersal.
* Can be **fleshy** (mango, apple, tomato) or **dry** (pea, groundnut).

#### Seeds:

  * Seeds grow into **new plants** when conditions are right (soil, water, air, warmth).
  * Ex: Wheat, Beans, Rice
  * **Parts of a seed**:

    * **Seed coat** – Outer covering, protects the seed.
    * **Cotyledons** – Store food for the baby plant. (1 in monocots, 2 in dicots).
    * **Embryo** – The **baby plant**, which later grows into root and shoot.

## Special Notes

Different parts of plants serve as food:


| **Plant Part** | **Examples**                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roots**      | Carrot, Beetroot, Radish, Turnip, Sweet Potato             |
| **Stems**      | Sugarcane, Potato, Ginger, Onion, Garlic                   |
| **Leaves**     | Spinach, Lettuce, Cabbage, Fenugreek (Methi), Mint         |
| **Flowers**    | Broccoli, Cauliflower, Banana Flower, Artichoke, Sunflower |
| **Fruits**     | Mango, Papaya, Apple, Banana, Guava, Tomato                |
| **Seeds**      | Wheat, Rice, Groundnut, Maize, Peas, Chickpea, Mustard     |

## Internal Structure of a Plant

Just like humans have organs like the heart, lungs, and stomach inside their body, plants also have **special tissues** inside them that help them live, grow, and survive. Each tissue has its own job, just like organs in our body.

---

### Epidermis – The Plant’s Skin

* The **epidermis** is the thin **outer covering** of a plant.
* It protects the plant from **injury, germs, and water loss**.
* In leaves, the epidermis may have a **waxy layer** called the **cuticle** that prevents the leaf from drying out.
* It also has tiny openings called **stomata**, which open and close to allow exchange of gases (for breathing and photosynthesis) and to release water vapor.

In animals and humans, the epidermis is also the **outer layer of skin**.
So, in both plants and animals, the epidermis means **the protective outer skin**.

Word origin: Greek **“epi”** = upon + **“derma”** = skin → “upon the skin”.

---

### Xylem – The Water Pipes of Plants

* Xylem is a **transport tissue** that carries **water and minerals** from the roots up to the stems and leaves.
* It works **only in one direction – upward** (from roots to top).
* Xylem also gives **strength and support** to the plant. In trees, the trunk’s wood is made mostly of xylem.

Think of xylem as the **water pipes** inside a plant.

Word origin: Greek **“xylon”** = wood (because xylem makes the woody part of plants).

---

### Phloem – The Food Delivery System

* Phloem is another transport tissue, but instead of water, it carries **food (mainly sugars)** made in the leaves to other parts of the plant such as stems, roots, flowers, and fruits.
* Unlike xylem, phloem can transport food **both upward and downward**.
* This movement of food is called **translocation**.

Think of phloem as the **delivery trucks** that take food everywhere in the plant.

Word origin: Greek **“phloos/phloios”** = bark (because phloem is found just below the bark).

---

### Parenchyma – The Filler Tissue

  * Parenchyma is the **most common tissue** in plants.
  * Its cells are **living, soft, and thin-walled**.
  * It works like a **filler**, filling spaces inside the plant body.
  * Functions:

    * **Stores food and water** (for example, in potatoes).
    * **Performs photosynthesis** when it has chlorophyll (this type is called **chlorenchyma**).
    * Helps the plant to **heal and repair** when injured.
    * Provides **temporary support** to soft parts of the plant.

Think of parenchyma like the **flesh of a fruit** that fills it up.

Word origin: Greek **“para”** = beside + **“enkhyma”** = poured in → “something filled in”.

---

### Chloroplasts – The Green Kitchens

* Chloroplasts are small **green parts inside leaf cells**.
* They contain **chlorophyll**, the green pigment that captures sunlight.
* Using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, chloroplasts make **food (glucose)** for the plant. This process is called **photosynthesis**.
* Chloroplasts also give plants their **green color**.

Think of chloroplasts as the **kitchens of the plant** that use sunlight to cook food.

Word origin: Greek **“chloros”** = green + **“plastos”** = formed → “green body”.

---

## How Plant Parts Work Together

Just like the organs in our body work together to keep us alive, the different parts of a plant also work together in a connected way. Each part has its own job, but they all depend on each other.

---

### 1. Roots – The Absorbers

* Roots grow deep into the soil and **absorb water and minerals** from it.
* They also **anchor the plant** firmly in the ground so it does not fall.
* The absorbed water and minerals are then passed into the **xylem**, the transport pipes of the plant.

---

### 2. Stem – The Transport Highway

* The stem works like a **highway** or **lift** inside the plant.
* Through the **xylem**, it carries water and minerals upward from the roots to the leaves.
* Through the **phloem**, it carries food (sugars) made in the leaves to all other parts of the plant.
* It also supports leaves, flowers, and fruits, holding them up to sunlight and air.

---

### 3. Leaves – The Food Factories

* Leaves are the **kitchens of the plant**.
* Using sunlight, water (from roots), and carbon dioxide (from air), the **chloroplasts** in leaves make food through **photosynthesis**.
* The food (mainly sugar) is then transported by the **phloem** to roots, stems, flowers, and fruits.
* Leaves also release extra water vapor and oxygen through **stomata**.

---

### 4. Flowers – The Reproductive Organs

* Flowers are the **reproductive parts** of plants.
* They produce **male and female gametes** (pollen and ovules) for reproduction.
* After pollination and fertilization, flowers turn into **fruits**.

---

### 5. Fruits – The Protectors of Seeds

* Fruits form after fertilization and their main job is to **protect the seeds** inside.
* Some fruits are fleshy and edible (like mango, apple), which attract animals to eat them and spread the seeds.
* Others are dry (like pea pods, nuts) and help in seed dispersal in different ways.

---

### 6. Seeds – The Next Generation

* Seeds are the **baby plants** waiting to grow.
* Each seed has an **embryo** (young plant) and stored food to help it germinate.
* When a seed gets the right conditions (water, air, warmth, and sometimes light), it grows into a **new plant**.

---

## Photosynthesis

Plants are called the **producers** of the Earth because they prepare their own food. The process through which they make food is known as **photosynthesis**. The word comes from:

- **Photo** = light
- **Synthesis** = putting together

So, photosynthesis means **“putting together with the help of light.”**

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use **sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO₂), and water (H₂O)** to make **food (glucose)** and release **oxygen (O₂)**.

The overall **chemical equation** is:
In words:
Carbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen

![photosynthesis](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-12-phtosynthesis.jpg)

---

### Ingredients Needed for Photosynthesis

For photosynthesis to happen, four main things are needed:

1. **Sunlight** – the energy source.
2. **Chlorophyll** – the green pigment in leaves that captures sunlight.
3. **Water** – absorbed by roots from the soil.
4. **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** – taken in through stomata (tiny pores in leaves).

---

### The Process Step by Step

1. Roots absorb **water** from the soil and send it to the leaves through xylem.
2. Leaves take in **carbon dioxide** from the air through stomata.
3. Chlorophyll inside leaf cells captures **sunlight**.
4. Using sunlight’s energy, the plant converts water and carbon dioxide into **glucose (food)**.
5. As a by-product, **oxygen** is released into the air.

This is why plants are called the **lungs of the Earth** – they give us oxygen to breathe.

---

### Where Does Photosynthesis Happen?

Photosynthesis occurs mainly in the **leaves**.

- Inside each leaf cell are small green structures called **chloroplasts**.
- Each chloroplast contains **chlorophyll** – the green pigment that traps sunlight.
- This is why only green plants can make their own food.

---

### Fun Facts about Photosynthesis

- 70% of oxygen in the atmosphere is produced by tiny plants in oceans called **phytoplankton**.
- Desert plants (cactus) perform photosynthesis with their stems instead of leaves.
- Photosynthesis not only produces food but also fuels fossil fuels (coal, petroleum) since they are ancient plant matter.

---

## What is Reproduction?

**Reproduction** is the process by which living things produce new individuals of their own kind.
For plants, reproduction ensures that the species does not disappear from Earth.

Plants reproduce in **two main ways**:

1. **Single parent reproduction** – New plants grow from parts like roots, stems, or leaves.
2. **Both parent reproduction** – New plants grow from seeds formed after pollination and fertilization.

---

## Single Parent Reproduction in Plants

In this type, only **one parent plant** is needed. No seeds are involved.

This reproduction produces **exact copies (clones)** of the parent plant.

![asexual](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-13-asexual.jpg)

--- 

### Vegetative Propagation

Vegetative propagation is a type of **asexual reproduction** in plants.
This means **new plants grow without seeds** – instead, they come from parts like roots, stems, or leaves.

In this method, a single parent plant can produce many new plants that are **exact copies** of it. Farmers and gardeners often use this method because it is **faster** and helps preserve good qualities of a plant (like sweetness of a fruit or beauty of a flower).

---

#### 1. Vegetative Propagation by Roots

Some plants can grow new shoots (baby plants) directly from their roots.

* **Sweet potato**: New plants grow from the root tubers.
* **Carrot** and **dahlia**: Their thickened roots store food and can give rise to new plants.

In these cases, the root is not just for storage but also acts as a way to produce more plants.

---

#### 2. Vegetative Propagation by Stems

Many plants have special types of stems that help them multiply.

* **Potato (tubers)**: The "eyes" or buds on a potato can sprout into new potato plants.
* **Onion (bulbs)**: The layers of the onion bulb grow into a new plant when planted.
* **Ginger (rhizomes)**: Underground horizontal stems that store food and sprout new shoots.
* **Strawberry (runners)**: Long, creeping stems grow along the ground, and at certain points, they give rise to new plants.

 This is one of the most common ways farmers grow crops like potato and onion on a large scale.

---

#### 3. Vegetative Propagation by Leaves

In some plants, even the leaves can grow into new plants.

* **Bryophyllum**: Tiny buds grow along the edges of its leaves. When the leaf falls on soil, these buds develop into new baby plants.

 This is a very special type of vegetative propagation found only in a few plants.

#### Why Vegetative Propagation is Useful

* Faster than growing plants from seeds.
* Produces **exact copies** (clones) of the parent plant.
* Helps farmers and gardeners maintain good qualities (taste, size, beauty).
* Some plants that rarely produce seeds can still reproduce by this method.

---

### **Cuttings**

Cuttings are one of the easiest and most common methods of **artificial vegetative propagation**. In this method, a **small part of a plant** (usually a stem, but sometimes a leaf or root) is cut and planted in the soil. With proper care, this cutting develops roots and shoots and grows into a **new plant**.

---

#### **How it Works**

1. A healthy portion of the plant is selected.
2. The cutting is usually 10–20 cm long and includes at least one or two buds.
3. The cut portion is planted in moist soil.
4. After some days, the buds on the cutting develop into new shoots, and roots grow from the lower end.
5. Gradually, the cutting becomes an **independent plant**.

---

#### **Examples**

* **Rose** – stem cuttings are used to grow new rose plants.
* **Hibiscus (China rose)** – grows easily from stem cuttings.
* **Sugarcane** – each piece of stem with a node can grow into a new sugarcane plant.
* **Money plant** – can be grown from stem cuttings placed in water or soil.

---

#### **Advantages of Cuttings**

* Very **quick and simple** method of growing plants.
* Helps gardeners and farmers produce many plants in a short time.
* New plants are **exact copies** of the parent plant.
* Useful for plants that don’t grow well from seeds or take too long to flower.

---

### **Layering**

Layering is another **artificial method of vegetative propagation**. In this method, a **living branch of a plant** is bent down to the ground and covered with moist soil while it is still attached to the parent plant. After some time, **roots develop** from the part of the branch that is covered with soil. Once the roots are strong, the branch is cut off from the parent plant and grows into a **new independent plant**.

---

#### **How it Works**

1. A **healthy, flexible branch** of the plant is chosen.
2. It is **bent downwards** so that part of it touches the soil.
3. That part is then **covered with moist soil**, while the tip of the branch remains above the ground.
4. After a few weeks, **roots sprout** from the buried part of the stem.
5. The rooted branch is finally **cut off** from the parent plant, and it continues to grow as a new plant.

---

#### **Examples**

* **Jasmine** – grown by layering.
* **Bougainvillea** – ornamental plant commonly propagated this way.
* **Strawberry** – naturally shows a type of layering (runners).
* **Guava and lemon** – sometimes grown using special forms of layering.

---

#### **Advantages of Layering**

* The new plant gets **nutrients from the parent plant** while developing, so chances of survival are high.
* Easy and cheap method, useful for **ornamental plants**.
* New plants are **identical to the parent plant** (true-to-type).

---

### **Grafting**

Grafting is an **artificial method of vegetative propagation** in which **two different plants** are joined together so that they grow as a **single plant**. This method combines the useful features of both plants.

* The **lower part of one plant** that remains rooted in the soil is called the **stock**.
* The **upper part of another plant** (usually a branch with buds) that is joined to it is called the **scion**.

When the scion and stock are tied or fixed together properly, they fuse and start growing as **one plant**.

---

#### **How it Works**

1. A healthy plant with strong roots is chosen as the **stock**.
2. Another plant with desired flowers, fruits, or branches is selected as the **scion**.
3. The stock is cut in a suitable way, and the scion is carefully placed on it.
4. Both parts are tied together firmly so that their tissues join.
5. Over time, the scion and stock grow together and form a **new plant**.

---

#### **Examples**

* **Mango** – to get tasty mango varieties.
* **Rose** – to produce better quality flowers.
* **Apple and citrus plants** – often propagated by grafting.

---

#### **Advantages of Grafting**

* Combines the **strength of stock** (healthy roots) with the **quality of scion** (good flowers/fruits).
* Helps grow **improved varieties** of plants.
* New plants **bear flowers and fruits faster** than those grown from seeds.
* Can produce plants that are **resistant to diseases**.

---

#### **Special Note**

* Grafting is commonly used in **fruit trees and ornamental plants**.
* It requires **skill and care**, unlike simple methods such as cuttings or layering.

---

### **Tissue Culture** (advanced method)

- A very small piece of plant tissue is grown in special conditions in a lab.
- Used to produce thousands of plants quickly.

## Both parents Reproduction in Plants

This is the most common way plants reproduce. It involves **flowers, seeds, and fruits**.

![sexual](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-14-sexual.jpg)

### The Role of Flowers

Flowers are the **reproductive organs of plants**.

- **Male part (Stamen)** → produces pollen.
- **Female part (Carpel/Pistil)** → contains ovary with ovules.

---

### Pollination

Pollination is the process by which **pollen** from the **anther** (male part) of a flower is transferred to the **stigma** (female part) of the same or another flower.

## ![Flower](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-15-whorls.jpg)

### ️ **Types of Pollination:**

  1. **Self-Pollination**

    - Pollen goes from the anther to the stigma **of the same flower**.
    - Example: Pea, Hibiscus

  2. **Cross-Pollination**

    - Pollen goes from the anther of **one flower** to the stigma of **another flower** of the same kind.
    - Example: Apple, Sunflower

--- 

### **Agents of Pollination:**

These help carry pollen from one flower to another:

| Agent       | Example                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Wind**    | Grass, wheat                           |
| **Water**   | Some aquatic plants                    |
| **Insects** | Bees, butterflies (most common agents) |
| **Birds**   | Hummingbirds                           |
| **Humans**  | Artificial pollination in farming      |


--- 

### **Pollen**

The word **_pollen_** comes from **Latin**:

- **Latin word**: _pollen_
- **Meaning**: "fine flour" or "dust"

### **Anther**

The word **_anther_** comes from:

- **Greek word**: _anthēra_
- Derived from: _anthos_ meaning **“flower”**

### **What is Style in a Flower?**

In a flower, the **style** is a **slender, tube-like part** of the female reproductive organ (called the **pistil**).

- It **connects the stigma** (top part) to the **ovary** (bottom part).
- After **pollination**, pollen grains land on the **stigma**.
- The pollen then **travels down the style** to reach the **ovary**, where **fertilization** happens.
- The **pistil** is the **female reproductive part** of a flower. It is located in the **center** of the flower and is made up of **three main parts**:


| Part       | Function                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Stigma** | Catches pollen                            |
| **Style**  | Passage for pollen to travel to the ovary |
| **Ovary**  | Contains ovules (will become seeds)       |

- **Carpel** is a single unit; when multiple carpels are fused, they form one **pistil**.
- A flower may have **one pistil** (simple) or **many fused/multiple pistils** (compound)

## The Four Whorls of a Flower

Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants. They are not just beautiful—they also play a very important role in the life cycle of the plant. One of the best ways to understand a flower is to look at its structure.

A typical flower has **four main parts**, known as **whorls**. These whorls are arranged in **circles** around the central part of the flower. Each whorl has a specific job to do.

![Flower](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/02-15-whorls.jpg)

Let’s explore these four whorls one by one:

1. **Calyx**
2. **Corolla**
3. **Androecium**
4. **Gynoecium**

---

## 1. **Calyx** – The Outer Whorl

### Definition

The **calyx** is the **outermost whorl** of a flower. It is usually green and leaf-like and is made up of individual units called **sepals**.

### Function

- **Protects** the flower when it is in the **bud stage**
- Helps in **photosynthesis** if green
- In some flowers, the calyx stays even after blooming and helps **protect the fruit**

### Etymology

- **Latin**: _calyx_ = "cup" or "husk"
- It refers to the cup-like structure that encloses the bud

### Examples

- In **Hibiscus**, the calyx is clearly visible as green leaf-like parts beneath the petals.
- In **brinjal (eggplant)** flowers, the calyx persists and forms the green part under the fruit.

--- 

## 2. **Corolla** – The Petal Whorl

### Definition

The **corolla** is the **second whorl**, made up of **petals**. Petals are often **brightly colored** and **fragrant**.

### Function

- Attracts **insects, birds, and pollinators** with its color and smell
- Helps in **guiding** pollinators to the nectar and reproductive parts
- In some plants, petals can also **protect inner parts** like sepals

### Etymology

- **Latin**: _corolla_ = "little crown"
- Because petals often form a crown-like shape around the center of the flower

### Examples

- In **rose**, the corolla is made up of the large, showy pink or red petals.
- In **sunflower**, the large yellow “petals” are actually part of the corolla.

--- 

## 3. **Androecium** – The Male Whorl

### Definition

The **androecium** is the **third whorl** and is the **male reproductive part** of the flower. It consists of **stamens**, and each stamen has two main parts:

1. **Anther** – produces **pollen grains**
2. **Filament** – holds up the anther

### Function

- Produces **pollen**, which contains the **male gametes (sperm cells)**
- Helps in **pollination** when insects or wind carry pollen to another flower

### Etymology

- **Greek**: _andros_ = "man" + _oikos_ = "house" → “house of man”
- Refers to the part of the flower that produces male gametes

### Examples

- In **lily**, you can clearly see six long stamens with yellow anthers.
- In **Hibiscus**, the stamens are joined together in a long tube surrounding the pistil.

### Note

In some flowers, all stamens are **separate**. In others, they may be **fused** by their filaments or anthers.

---

## 4. **Gynoecium** – The Female Whorl

### Definition

The **gynoecium** is the **innermost whorl** and is the **female reproductive part** of the flower. It is made up of one or more **carpels** (or pistils).

Each **carpel** has three main parts:

1. **Stigma** – sticky part that receives pollen
2. **Style** – tube that carries pollen down to the ovary
3. **Ovary** – contains **ovules** (eggs)

### Function

- Receives **pollen** during pollination
- **Fertilization** happens inside the ovary when the male and female gametes meet
- Ovary later develops into a **fruit**, and ovules become **seeds**

### Etymology

- **Greek**: _gynē_ = "woman" + _oikos_ = "house" → “house of woman”
- Refers to the part that produces and carries the **female gametes (egg cells)**

### Examples

- In **pea plants**, the ovary is found at the base of the flower and develops into a pod.
- In **hibiscus**, the stigma is at the tip, surrounded by stamens, and the ovary is hidden at the base.

---

### Perfect and Imperfect Flowers

- **Perfect Flower**: Has all **four whorls** (e.g., Hibiscus, Rose)
- **Imperfect Flower**: Missing either androecium or gynoecium (e.g., Papaya, Corn)

---

## Seed Dispersal

If all seeds fall near the parent plant, they will compete for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
So, seeds are dispersed to different places by:

- **Wind** – light seeds like dandelion, maple.
- **Water** – floating seeds like coconut, lotus.
- **Animals** – seeds with hooks (burdock) stick to fur, or fruits are eaten and seeds dropped.
- **Explosion** – pea and balsam pods burst and scatter seeds.

---

## Germination of Seeds

When a seed falls on soil with the right conditions (water, air, warmth), it begins to grow into a new plant.

- When a seed gets water, oxygen, and the right temperature, it starts to sprout.
- The seed coat breaks open.
- The root (radicle) comes out first, followed by the shoot (plumule).

### Conditions needed for germination

- **Water (moisture)** – softens seed coat.
- **Air (oxygen)** – for respiration.
- **Warmth** – suitable temperature.

### Stages of germination

1. Seed absorbs water and swells.
2. Seed coat breaks.
3. Tiny root (radicle) comes out first.
4. Shoot (plumule) grows upward.
5. Leaves form and begin photosynthesis.

---

## Fun Facts about Plant Reproduction

- A single dandelion plant can produce thousands of seeds carried by wind.
- Coconut is the world champion of **water dispersal** – it can travel thousands of kilometers across seas.
- Bananas sold in markets are **seedless** – they are grown by vegetative propagation.
- The world’s largest seed is the **Coco de Mer** (double coconut) – it can weigh up to **25 kg**!

---

## Desert Plants (Xerophytes)

Desert plants grow in hot, dry places where **water is very limited**. To survive, they have special features called **adaptations**.

### **Key Adaptations**

  1. **Thick, waxy stems**

    * The stems are thick and covered with a waxy layer.
    * This helps the plant **store water** for many days and prevents water from evaporating.
    * **Example:** *Cactus* (Opuntia) stores water in its fleshy stem.

  2. **Leaves reduced to spines**

    * Instead of broad leaves, many desert plants have **spines**.
    * Spines stop water loss and also protect the plant from animals.
    * **Example:** *Prickly pear cactus* has spines instead of leaves.

  3. **Green stems for photosynthesis**

    * Since leaves are reduced, the **stem takes over the job of making food** (photosynthesis).
    * The green stem contains **chlorophyll** for this purpose.
    * **Example:** *Euphorbia* and *cactus* perform photosynthesis in stems.

  4. **Deep roots**

    * Some desert plants grow **very long roots** that go deep underground.
    * These roots reach hidden underground water sources.
    * **Example:** *Mesquite tree* has roots that may grow more than 30 meters deep.

  5. **Shallow, widespread roots**

    * Some plants spread their roots just under the surface.
    * These roots are **wide and shallow**, so they can quickly soak up rainwater before it dries.
    * **Example:** *Cactus* and *Agave* spread their roots widely to catch water.

---

## Aquatic Plants (Hydrophytes)

Aquatic plants grow in **water bodies** such as ponds, rivers, and lakes.
They have special features (adaptations) that help them live and survive in water.

### **Types of Aquatic Plants**

---

### 1. **Floating Plants**

*(Examples: Water hyacinth, Duckweed)*

* These plants **float freely** on the surface of water.
* Their stems are **light, hollow, and spongy**, filled with air spaces that keep them afloat.
* Their leaves have **stomata on the upper surface** (not the lower surface, like land plants), since only the top part touches the air.
* They move easily with water currents.

 **Example:** *Water hyacinth* floats like a green carpet on ponds; *duckweed* looks like tiny green dots covering the water surface.

---

### 2. **Fixed Plants**

*(Examples: Water lily, Lotus)*

* These plants are rooted in the **mud at the bottom** of ponds.
* They have **long, flexible stems** that can bend with the flow of water without breaking.
* Their **broad, flat leaves float on the surface**, helping them absorb maximum sunlight for photosynthesis.
* Flowers rise above water, making pollination easy.

 **Example:** *Lotus* has large round leaves and beautiful pink flowers; *water lily* has flat leaves like green plates on the water.

---

### 3. **Submerged Plants**

*(Examples: Hydrilla, Vallisneria)*

* These plants live **completely underwater**.
* Their leaves are **thin, narrow, and ribbon-like**, which allows water to flow around them without damage.
* They do not have stomata, since gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) are **absorbed directly from water**.
* They help keep the water clean by providing oxygen.

 **Example:** *Hydrilla* is a common submerged plant seen in aquariums; *Vallisneria* has long grass-like leaves waving underwater.

---

## Tropical Rainforest Plants

Tropical rainforests are found in **hot and wet regions** near the equator (like the Amazon, Congo, and Southeast Asia).
They get **heavy rainfall** throughout the year and have a **thick canopy** (dense tree cover), which blocks most of the sunlight from reaching the ground.

Because of this, rainforest plants have developed **special adaptations** to survive in such conditions.

---

### **Key Adaptations**

  1. **Large leaves with drip tips**

    * Leaves are **very big and broad** so they can catch maximum sunlight that filters through tall trees.
    * The pointed **drip tips** help rainwater roll off quickly, preventing the growth of fungi or bacteria.
    *  *Example:* Many rainforest trees like the **banana plant** and **taro** have large drip-tip leaves.

---

  2. **Climbing vines (Lianas)**

    * Lianas are **woody creepers** that start at the ground and **climb tall trees** to reach sunlight.
    * They twine around trunks or hang like ropes, getting support from big trees.
    *  *Example:* **Rattan palm** is a liana that climbs high to get sunlight.

---

  3. **Epiphytes (plants growing on other plants)**

    * Epiphytes grow on **branches or trunks of tall trees**.
    * They do not take food from the host tree, but use it as support to reach sunlight.
    * They absorb moisture and nutrients from **air and rainwater**.
    *  *Example:* **Orchids** and **ferns** are common rainforest epiphytes.

---

  4. **Tall trees with buttress roots**

    * The soil in rainforests is often **shallow and poor in nutrients**.
    * Tall trees develop **buttress roots** (big, wide, above-ground roots) for **support and stability**.
    * These roots also help absorb nutrients from the surface soil.
    *  *Example:* The **Kapok tree** grows very tall (up to 70 m) and has massive buttress roots.

---

### **Examples of Rainforest Plants**

*  **Orchid** → an epiphyte that grows on tall trees without harming them.
*  **Kapok tree** → a giant tree with wide buttress roots that provide stability.
*  **Banana plant** → has large broad leaves to capture sunlight.
*  **Ferns** → grow well in the moist, shady rainforest floor.

---

## ️ Cold-Region Plants

Cold regions include **high mountains** (like the Himalayas, Alps, Rockies) and **polar regions** (like the Arctic and Antarctica).
These areas have **extreme cold, snow, icy winds, and short summers**. The soil often remains frozen, making it difficult for plants to grow.
Yet, some plants have **special adaptations** to survive in such harsh conditions.

---

### **Key Adaptations**

  1. **Conical shape**

    * Many mountain trees are **cone-shaped**.
    * This shape helps **snow slide off easily** instead of collecting on branches, which could break them.
    *  *Example:* **Pine and fir trees** have a perfect conical shape.

---

  2. **Needle-like leaves**

    * Leaves are **thin, long, and needle-shaped**.
    * This reduces the surface area → prevents **water loss** (as water is scarce in frozen soil).
    * A waxy coating also protects them from **freezing temperatures**.
    *  *Example:* **Spruce and cedar** have needle-shaped leaves.

---

  3. **Evergreen habit**

    * Plants remain **green throughout the year** instead of shedding leaves.
    * This allows them to **make food (photosynthesize)** whenever sunlight is available, even in short summers.
    *  *Example:* **Pine and fir** stay green all year.

---

  4. **Thick bark**

    * Many cold-region trees have **thick and rough bark**.
    * This bark acts like a **blanket**, protecting the inner tissues from extreme cold and frost.
    *  *Example:* **Spruce** has thick protective bark.

---

  5. **Low-growing plants (Alpine plants)**

    * In high mountain areas above the tree line, plants cannot grow tall because of **icy winds**.
    * So, they remain **small and close to the ground**, which protects them from wind damage and helps them trap warmth from the soil.
    *  *Example:* **Mosses, lichens, and cushion plants** grow low and spread on the ground.

---

### **Examples of Cold-Region Plants**

*  **Pine, spruce, fir** → tall, cone-shaped, evergreen conifers with needle-like leaves.
*  **Alpine plants** → mosses, lichens, and cushion plants that survive near the ground in extreme cold.
*  **Juniper** → hardy shrub that withstands snow and strong winds.

---

##  Grassland Plants

Grasslands are open areas covered mainly with **grasses** and a few scattered trees or shrubs.
They are found in places with **long dry seasons**, **strong winds**, and many **grazing animals** (like cows, deer, zebras).
Since fire and grazing are common, plants here have developed special ways to **survive and regrow quickly**.

---

### **Key Adaptations**

  1. **Narrow leaves**

    * Leaves are **thin and narrow**, which reduces the surface area.
    * This helps in **reducing water loss** during dry and hot seasons.
    *  *Example:* **Tall grasses in African savannas** have narrow leaves that prevent drying out.

---

  2. **Flexible stems**

    * Stems of grassland plants are **soft and bend easily**.
    * This prevents them from breaking during **strong winds** or when animals step on them.
    *  *Example:* **Prairie grasses** in North America can bend and survive storms.

---

  3. **Deep roots**

    * Grassland plants develop **long and deep roots**.
    * These roots help them **absorb underground water** during droughts.
    * Deep roots also **anchor the plant firmly**, protecting them from being uprooted by grazing animals.
    *  *Example:* **Buffalo grass** has deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions.

---

  4. **Fast regrowth after grazing or fire**

    * Since animals eat grass frequently, grasses have the ability to **regrow quickly** from their base.
    * Even if the top part is eaten or destroyed by fire, the underground part survives and grows again.
    *  *Example:* **Elephant grass in India and Africa** grows back quickly after being grazed.

---

  5. **Scattered trees with special features**

    * In some grasslands, there are few trees like **acacia**.
    * These trees have **small leaves (or thorns)** to reduce water loss and protect themselves from grazing animals.
    *  *Example:* **Acacia trees in African savannas** survive droughts and animal browsing.

---

### **Examples of Grassland Plants**

*  **Grasses** → tall grasses (elephant grass, pampas grass, prairie grass).
*  **Acacia trees** → scattered, thorny trees in African and Indian grasslands.
*  **Wildflowers** → daisies, sunflowers in temperate grasslands.

---

##  Mangrove Plants

Mangrove plants grow in **salty, muddy coastal areas** where normal plants cannot survive.
These areas often have **low oxygen in the soil**, **high salt content**, and are regularly **flooded by tides**.
To survive in such tough conditions, mangrove plants have developed **special adaptations**.

---

### **Key Adaptations**

  1. **Breathing roots (Pneumatophores)** ️

    * In mangroves, the soil is **muddy and airless** (no oxygen underground).
    * So, the plants develop **special roots that grow upward** and stick out of the soil like straws.
    * These roots take in **oxygen directly from the air**.
    *  *Example:* **Sundari tree (Heritiera fomes)** and **Avicennia (black mangrove)** have breathing roots.

---

  2. **Thick, waxy leaves** 

    * The leaves are **thick, leathery, and covered with wax**.
    * This helps to **reduce water loss** in the salty, hot environment.
    * The waxy surface also prevents **too much salt** from entering the plant.
    *  *Example:* **Rhizophora (red mangrove)** has thick leaves that store water.

---

  3. **Salt glands** 

    * Since mangroves grow in salty water, they have **special glands on their leaves**.
    * These glands **excrete extra salt**, keeping the plant safe from damage.
    * Sometimes you can see **salt crystals** on the leaves.
    *  *Example:* **Avicennia (black mangrove)** has salt glands that push salt out.

---

  4. **Prop roots for support** 

    * Mangrove soil is **soft and unstable**.
    * Some mangroves (like red mangroves) have **prop roots** that come out from the trunk and go deep into the soil.
    * These roots **support the tree** like pillars and keep it standing firmly.
    *  *Example:* **Red mangrove (Rhizophora)** has strong prop roots.

---

  5. **Vivipary (seeds that germinate while still on the tree)** 

    * Mangrove seeds start **growing into seedlings while still attached** to the parent plant.
    * Once mature, they fall into the mud or water and **immediately start growing**.
    * This ensures the young plant survives in the harsh coastal conditions.
    *  *Example:* **Rhizophora and Bruguiera** show vivipary.

---

### **Examples of Mangrove Plants**

*  **Sundari tree** (*Heritiera fomes*) → found in Sundarbans (India & Bangladesh).
*  **Red mangrove** (*Rhizophora*) → has prop roots and vivipary seeds.
*  **Black mangrove** (*Avicennia*) → has pneumatophores and salt glands.

Since ancient times, plants have been used as natural healers.

- **Tulsi (Holy Basil):** Used for cough and cold.
- **Neem:** Known for antibacterial properties.
- **Aloe vera:** Heals wounds and burns.
- **Turmeric:** Powerful anti-inflammatory spice.
- **Cinchona tree:** used to treat malaria.
