#  Matter and Materials

## **Section 1: Introduction to Matter**


Matter is one of the most fundamental concepts in science. Everything we see, touch, smell, or use in our everyday lives is made of matter. From the chair you sit on, the clothes you wear, the food you eat, to the air you breathe—all of these are different forms of matter. Even living things, such as plants and animals, are made of matter.

Everything that is present around us—buildings, chairs, cars, bicycles, water in a water bottle, plants, animals and even the air that we cannot see—is all made of matter. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Let us learn more about it.

### **What is Matter?**

Matter is defined as *anything that has mass and occupies space (volume).* This means that if something can be weighed and it takes up space, it is matter. For example:

* A stone has weight (mass) and takes up space—it is matter.
* Air, although invisible, also has weight and takes up space—it is matter.
* A drop of water has weight and volume—it is matter.

On the other hand, concepts like **time, energy, or thoughts** are not matter because they do not have mass or occupy space.

### **Modern Scientific View**

Today, scientists know that matter is made up of tiny particles called **atoms.** These atoms combine to form **molecules,** which then form the substances we see. For example:

* A molecule of water (H₂O) is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
* Table salt (NaCl) is made of sodium and chlorine atoms.

Understanding atoms and molecules helps scientists explain why different materials behave differently—for example, why metals conduct electricity, or why wood floats on water.

## **Section 2: Fundamental Properties of Matter**


Matter is not just “stuff.” It has specific **properties** that can be measured, compared, and studied. These properties help scientists and engineers choose the right materials for different purposes.

### **2.1 Mass**

Mass is the amount of matter in an object.

* It is measured using a balance or scale.
* The SI unit of mass is **kilogram (kg).**

Examples:

* A bag of rice may have a mass of 10 kg.
* Your school bag may have a mass of 3 kg.
* Even a tiny grain of sand has mass, although it is very small.

Mass is different from **weight**. Mass is the same everywhere in the universe, but weight changes depending on gravity.

### **2.2 Volume**

Volume is the amount of space matter occupies.

* Liquids are measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL).
* Solids can be measured in cubic centimeters (cm³) or cubic meters (m³).

Examples:

* A water bottle may hold 1 liter of water.
* A small box may have a volume of 200 cm³.
* Even gases like oxygen and nitrogen occupy space (this is why a balloon expands when filled with air).

### **2.3 Density**

Density is the mass of matter per unit volume.
It can be calculated as:

Density = Mass / Volume

Examples:

* A piece of iron feels heavier than a piece of wood of the same size because iron has higher density.
* Ice floats on water because ice has lower density than liquid water.

Density is a very important property used in designing ships, submarines, and even airplanes.

### **2.4 Weight**

Weight is the **force of gravity** acting on the mass of an object.

* It is measured in newtons (N).
* Formula:

Weight = Mass * Gravity

For example:

* On Earth, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 9.8 N.
* On the Moon, the same 1 kg mass weighs less because the Moon’s gravity is weaker.

This shows why astronauts on the Moon can jump higher than on Earth—their weight is less, even though their mass is the same.

### **2.5 Inertia**

Inertia is the property of matter that resists changes in motion.

* A moving ball keeps rolling until friction or another force stops it.
* A book on a table will not move unless you push it.

This property is explained in **Newton’s First Law of Motion,** which states: “An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a force.”

### **2.6 Other General Properties**

* **Shape:** Solids have a definite shape, while liquids and gases do not.
* **Compressibility:** Gases can be compressed easily, but solids and liquids are hard to compress.
* **Visibility:** Some matter (like glass) is transparent, while others (like wood) are opaque.

### **2.7 Importance in Daily Life**

* Density explains why ships float.
* Mass and volume explain why heavy trucks have bigger tires (to distribute weight).
* Inertia explains why you lurch forward when a bus stops suddenly.

---

### Density explains why ships float.

A solid block of metal sinks since it is denser than water, but a ship is built hollow and wide, filled with air spaces. This makes its **average density less than water**, so when placed in water, it pushes water aside (displaces it). The displaced water pushes back with an upward force, which balances the ship’s weight and keeps it floating.

--- 

### Mass and volume explain why heavy trucks have bigger tires (to distribute weight).

Heavy trucks are very heavy because of their large **mass**. When such a heavy vehicle stands on the ground, all that weight presses downward. If the weight is concentrated on a small area, the **pressure** on the ground becomes very high.

To reduce this pressure, trucks are fitted with **big and wide tires**. A large tire has more **surface area** touching the ground. This spreads the truck’s weight over a bigger area, which lowers the pressure on each part of the ground.

That is why trucks do not sink into soft soil or damage the road easily. 

--- 

###  **Situation in a Moving Bus**

* When the bus is moving at a constant speed, **you and the bus are both moving forward at the same velocity**.
* Your whole body and the bus share the same motion.
* The bus is brought to rest by the **braking force** applied on its wheels.
* The **part of your body in contact with the bus** (your feet, lower body on the seat, or hand if holding a rod) stops **along with the bus**.
* But the **upper part of your body is not directly connected to the bus**. Because of inertia, it **keeps moving forward** at the same speed the bus had before stopping.
* As a result, your upper body **lurches or leans forward**.
* Very soon, other forces (friction between you and the seat, muscles in your body, or if you hold a support/handle) **pull your upper body back** and bring it to rest.
* But for a brief moment, you feel that **jerk forward**.

---

## **Section 3: States of Matter**

All matter in the universe exists in different **states** depending on how its particles are arranged and how much energy they have. The most common states of matter we see in daily life are **solid, liquid, and gas.** Scientists have also discovered other states such as **plasma** and **Bose-Einstein condensate.**

---

### **3.1 Solids**

* **Definition:** Solids have a **definite shape and definite volume.**

In solids, particles are packed together very tightly with very little space between them.  They cannot move freely but vibrate in place. Therefore:
- Solids are rigid.
- They have a fixed shape and occupy a fixed volume.
- They cannot flow or be compressed (pressed and made smaller). However, the shape of some solids can change when a force is applied.
* They have high density compared to liquids and gases.

Examples of solids are chairs, notebooks, pens, utensils, paper, cotton and cloth.

Crystals are types of solids. Their particles are arranged in a pattern. Sugar, copper sulphate and alum are some substances that exist as crystals.

---

### **3.2 Liquids**

* **Definition:** Liquids have a **definite volume but no definite shape.** They take the shape of their container.
- In liquids, particles are packed together, but not as tightly as they are in solids. The particles can move and slide over one another. Therefore:

- Liquids do not have a fixed shape, but have a fixed volume.
- They cannot be compressed.
- They flow from one place to another.
- They take the shape of their container.
* They can be poured.
* They have surface tension (water droplets form spheres).

Examples of liquids are water, milk, honey and oil.

Liquids flow from a higher level to a lower level due to gravity. Some liquids such as honey flow slowly, while others such as milk and water flow much faster.

---

### Due to surface tension water droplets form spheres

**Surface tension** is the property of a liquid surface that makes it behave like a **stretched elastic sheet**.

* Inside the liquid: Each molecule is surrounded by other molecules from all sides. The attractive forces cancel out → net force is zero.
* On the surface: Molecules do not have neighbors above them, so they are **pulled inward** by the molecules below and sideways.
* This imbalance creates a **contracting force on the surface**, making the liquid surface act like a stretched membrane.
* Water molecules are strongly attracted to each other due to **cohesion**
* For a given volume, a **sphere has the least possible surface area** compared to any other shape (cube, cylinder, irregular shape, etc.).
* Since liquids “want” to minimize surface area, **surface tension pulls the droplet into a spherical shape**.
* Soap bubbles are spherical for the same reason (though they enclose air instead of liquid).

---

### **3.3 Gases**

* **Definition:** Gases have **no definite shape and no definite volume.** They expand to fill any container.
- In gases, the particles are very loosely packed and can move freely. Therefore:

**Properties of Gases:**

- Gases do not have a specific shape or volume.
- They expand to fill all the space in the container which they occupy. Their particles can even move out of the container if it is not sealed tightly.
- Gases can also be compressed and can flow from one place to another.
* They are usually invisible to the eye.
* They mix completely with other gases (oxygen and nitrogen in the air).

Air is made up of many gases.

**Examples in daily life:**

* Oxygen, carbon dioxide, steam, natural gas, LPG.

---

### **Why gases expand to occupy all available space?**

### 1. **Nature of gas molecules**

* Gas molecules are **very far apart** compared to solids and liquids.
* The forces of attraction between them are **negligible**.
* They move in **all directions randomly** with high speed.

### 2. **Kinetic molecular theory**

* According to this theory, gas particles are in **constant, rapid motion**.
* They collide with each other and with the walls of the container.

### 3. **Effect of container size**

* If the container is small → molecules keep hitting the walls frequently → gas fills the space.
* If the container is large → molecules spread out, but still move until they occupy **all corners** of the container.

### 4. **Reason they occupy all available space**

* Since there are **no strong attractive forces** pulling them together, nothing prevents gas molecules from spreading.
* Their **kinetic energy + random motion** makes them distribute evenly everywhere.

---

### **Examples in daily life**

* **Perfume smell spreads** across the room because gas molecules diffuse until the whole room is filled.
* **Air in a balloon** expands uniformly to fill the balloon’s shape.
* **Cooking gas leak** spreads to every corner of the kitchen.

Gases expand to fill all available space because their particles move freely and rapidly in all directions, with almost no attraction between them.

---

### **Meaning of Diffusion**

**Diffusion** is the natural process by which particles (atoms or molecules) move from a region of **high concentration** to a region of **low concentration**, until they are **evenly spread out**.

So when we say **"gas molecules diffuse,"** it means:

* Gas molecules move **randomly** in all directions.
* They gradually **spread out and mix** with other gas molecules without needing stirring or shaking.

### **Why Does Diffusion Happen in Gases?**

* Gas molecules are **far apart** and have **weak intermolecular forces**.
* They are in **constant, rapid motion** due to kinetic energy.
* When they collide with each other, they bounce and change direction → over time they **spread throughout the container**.

**Examples:**

* **Perfume or deodorant** → When sprayed in one corner of a room, the smell reaches everyone because gas molecules diffuse through the air.
* **Cooking gas leak** → The LPG spreads throughout the kitchen.
* **Oxygen and carbon dioxide in lungs** → In alveoli, oxygen diffuses from air into blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses from blood into air.

---

### **3.4 Plasma (Advanced Knowledge)**

* Plasma is sometimes called the **fourth state of matter.**
* It consists of gas-like particles that are electrically charged.
* Plasma is found in **stars, lightning, neon signs, and fluorescent lamps.**
* It is the most common state of matter in the universe (most of the Sun and stars are made of plasma).

"Plasma screen" is a display that works by exciting gases to produce light, but it was used in TVs, not in mobile phones. Modern mobiles use LCD or OLED, which are more efficient and compact.

---

### **3.5 Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)**

* This is called the **fifth state of matter.**
* It was discovered by Indian scientist **Satyendra Nath Bose** and **Albert Einstein.**
* It occurs at extremely low temperatures close to **absolute zero (-273°C).**
* At this point, particles behave as one single “super-particle.”

---

## **Section 4: Changes in States of Matter**

Matter can change from one state to another when **heat energy** is added or removed. These changes are usually **physical changes** (they can be reversed).

---

### **4.1 Melting**

* **Definition:** Change from **solid to liquid.**
* **Process:** When a solid is heated, its particles gain energy and start vibrating faster. At a certain temperature (melting point), they break free from fixed positions.

**Examples:**

  * Ice melting into water.
  * Butter melting on a hot pan.
  * Wax melting when a candle burns.

---

### **4.2 Freezing**

* **Definition:** Change from **liquid to solid.**
* **Process:** When a liquid is cooled, particles lose energy and settle into fixed positions.

**Examples:**

  * Water freezing into ice.
  * Juice turning into ice popsicles in the freezer.

---

### **4.3 Evaporation**

* **Definition:** Change from **liquid to gas** without boiling.
* **Process:** Happens at the surface of a liquid at any temperature. Faster when heat, airflow, or surface area increases.

**Examples:**

  * Wet clothes drying in the sun.
  * Sweat evaporating to cool our body.

---

### **4.4 Boiling**

* **Definition:** Rapid change from **liquid to gas** throughout the liquid at a fixed temperature (boiling point).

**Examples:**

  * Water boiling at 100°C to form steam.
  * Milk boiling and forming bubbles.

---

### **4.5 Condensation**

* **Definition:** Change from **gas to liquid.**
* **Process:** When gas cools, particles lose energy and come closer together.

**Examples:**

  * Water droplets forming on the outside of a cold glass.
  * Clouds forming when water vapor condenses.

---

### **4.6 Sublimation**

* **Definition:** Change from **solid directly to gas** without becoming liquid.

**Examples:**

* Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) turning into carbon dioxide gas.
* Snow in very cold, dry regions (like the Himalayas or Antarctica) → snow and ice can slowly change into water vapor without melting.
* Frost on cold mornings → sometimes disappears directly into vapor when sunlight hits.
* Glaciers → in very dry, cold air, ice sublimates directly into water vapor.

---

### **4.7 Deposition**

* **Definition:** Change from **gas directly to solid.**

**Examples:**

  * Frost forming on leaves in winter.
  * Ice crystals forming on windows.

---

## **Section 5: Materials – Natural and Synthetic**

Materials are the substances from which objects are made. Every object around us—whether it’s a table, a glass, or a shirt—is made from some material. These materials can be broadly divided into **natural materials** (found in nature) and **synthetic materials** (made by humans in factories).

---

### **5.1 Natural Materials**

* **Insoluble materials:** Sand, oil, chalk powder.
* Important in cooking, cleaning, and making medicines.

---

## **Section 7: Mixtures and Solutions**

### **What is a Mixture?**

A **mixture** is formed when two or more substances are physically combined but not chemically bonded.

* Example: Sand and salt, air (mixture of gases), fruit salad.

**Characteristics of mixtures:**

* Components keep their individual properties.
* Can usually be separated by physical methods (like filtration, evaporation, or using magnets).
* Do not have fixed proportions (you can mix in different amounts).

---

### **Types of Mixtures**

#### 1. **Homogeneous mixture:** Uniform throughout, cannot see different parts.

  * Example: Salt dissolved in water, air.

#### 2. **Heterogeneous mixture:** Non-uniform, different parts are visible.

  * Example: Oil and water, sand and iron filings.

---

### **What is a Solution?**

A **solution** is a special type of homogeneous mixture where one substance dissolves in another.

Many substances can be mixed or dissolved in another substance. The substance formed by mixing two or more substances is called a mixture. If one substance dissolves in a substance and spreads evenly in it, this mixture is called a solution.

The substance that is dissolved in another substance is called the solute. The substance that dissolves the solute is called the solvent.

Mix a spoon of sugar in water till the sugar disappears. Here, water is the solvent, sugar is the solute and the sweet water formed is sugar solution

* **Solute:** The substance that gets dissolved. (Salt in salt water)
* **Solvent:** The substance that dissolves the solute. (Water in salt water)
* **Solution:** The final uniform mixture.

**Examples:** Sugar in tea, carbon dioxide in soda water.

#### Soluble and Insoluble Substances

A substance that dissolves in a solvent to form a solution is said to be soluble in that solvent. However, a substance that does not dissolve in a solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent.

Remember, a substance may be insoluble in one solvent, but soluble in another. For example, wax dissolves in kerosene but not in water. Therefore, wax is soluble in kerosene but insoluble in water.

Water is a special liquid. Many substances dissolve in it. For this reason, it is called the universal solvent.

#### Miscible and Immiscible Liquids

Some liquids mix with each other completely and are called miscible liquids. Liquids that do not mix with each other easily are called immiscible liquids. Water and milk are miscible with each other. However, oil and water are immiscible. When mixed, the lighter liquid (oil) floats on top of the heavier liquid (water).



---

### **Factors Affecting Solubility**

1. **Temperature:** Higher temperature usually increases solubility of solids in liquids. **Example**: Sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than cold water.

2. **Stirring:** Helps distribute solute particles quickly.

3. **Particle size:** Smaller particles dissolve faster.

4. **Nature of solute and solvent:** “Like dissolves like” – Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents.

---
### SEPARATION OF SUBSTANCES

Solutions can be of different types based on whether the solute and solvent are solids, liquids or gases. Let us study some methods to separate soluble and insoluble solids from liquids in a mixture

#### Separation of Insoluble Solids

Insoluble solids can be separated from a liquid by sedimentation and decantation, or filtration.

#### Sedimentation and decantation

Heavy insoluble solids can be separated from a liquid by sedimentation and decantation.

- Sedimentation: First, the mixture is allowed to stand undisturbed for some time. Insoluble particles settle at the bottom of the beaker as sediment.
- Decantation: The clear liquid left above the sediment is called the supernatant. It is carefully poured into another beaker without disturbing the sediment.


#### Filtration

Filtration is used to separate light insoluble solids from a liquid. During the process, the mixture is passed through a filter (a material with tiny holes) that allows the liquid to pass but holds back the insoluble impurities. The liquid that collects after filtration is called the filtrate. The insoluble impurities left on the filter form a residue.

Filter paper and muslin cloth are examples of materials used for filtration. Tea leaves are filtered from tea using a tea strainer or sieve.

--- 
### Separation of Soluble Substances

Soluble substances can be separated from liquids by evaporation or distillation.

#### Evaporation

Evaporation involves heating a solution containing soluble impurities to make it boil. Only the liquid solvent turns into a vapour and is lost. The substance that is left behind in the beaker is the soluble impurity. Salt or sugar dissolved in water can be separated by this method.

#### Distillation

During distillation, a solution with soluble impurities is first heated to form vapour leaving the solute behind. The vapour is condensed separately to get back the liquid solvent. Thus, both the solute and solvent are recovered.

The solvent obtained by distillation is pure and is called the distillate. Distilled water is the purest form of water.

--- 

### **Methods of Separating Mixtures**

* **Filtration:** To separate solids from liquids (sand and water).
* **Evaporation:** To get solute from solution (salt from seawater).
* **Magnetic separation:** To separate iron from sand.
* **Distillation:** To separate liquids with different boiling points (alcohol and water).
* **Chromatography:** To separate colors in ink.

---

## **Section 8: Atoms, Molecules, and Elements**

To truly understand matter, we must look deeper at what it is made of: **atoms and molecules**.

---

### **What is an Atom?**

* The smallest unit of matter that cannot be divided further by chemical means.
* Every material in the universe is made of atoms.
* Example: A gold atom is the smallest part of gold that is still gold.

Atoms are like the **building blocks** of matter, just like bricks in a house.

---

### **Structure of an Atom**

* **Nucleus:** Center of the atom, contains protons (+ charge) and neutrons (no charge).
* **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles that move around the nucleus in shells.

An atom is mostly empty space, but the arrangement of electrons determines how it reacts with other atoms.

---

### **What is a Molecule?**

A **molecule** is formed when two or more atoms join together chemically.

* Example: Oxygen gas (O₂) has 2 oxygen atoms.
* Water (H₂O) has 2 hydrogen atoms + 1 oxygen atom.

Molecules can be made of the same element (O₂) or different elements (H₂O).

---

### **Elements and Compounds**

* **Element:** Pure substance made of only one type of atom. (Gold, Oxygen, Iron)
* **Compound:** Substance made of two or more elements chemically combined. (Water, Carbon dioxide, Salt)

**Difference:**

* Salt (NaCl) is a compound – its properties are different from sodium (metal) and chlorine (toxic gas).
* Iron (Fe) is an element – it cannot be broken into simpler substances by chemical methods.

---

### **Periodic Table of Elements**

* Scientists have discovered over 118 elements.
* The **Periodic Table** arranges them according to their properties.
* Metals, non-metals, and noble gases are grouped for easier understanding.

---

### **Importance of Atoms and Molecules**

* Explain why materials behave differently (gold is shiny, wood burns, iron rusts).
* Help in making new materials (plastic, medicines).
* Fundamental to understanding chemistry.


---

## **Section 9: Heat and Materials**

Heat plays a very important role in how materials behave. Some materials allow heat to pass through easily, while others do not.

---

### **What is Heat?**

* Heat is a form of energy that makes things warm.
* It always flows from a hotter object to a colder one.
* Example: A hot spoon placed in cold water transfers heat to the water.

---

### **Conductors and Insulators**

#### 1. **Conductors of Heat**

   * Substances that allow heat to pass through them easily.
   * Metals like iron, copper, aluminum are good conductors.
   * That is why cooking pans are made of metal.

#### 2. **Insulators of Heat**

   * Substances that do not allow heat to pass easily.
   * Wood, plastic, rubber, and wool are insulators.
   * That is why cooking pans have plastic or wooden handles.

---

### **Expansion and Contraction of Materials**

When materials are heated:

* They **expand** (become larger).
* When cooled, they **contract** (become smaller).

**Examples:**

* Railway tracks have gaps to allow expansion in hot weather.
* Electric wires sag in summer (expansion) and tighten in winter (contraction).

---

### **Change of State by Heat**

Heat can change the state of matter:

* Solid → Liquid (melting)
* Liquid → Gas (evaporation/boiling)
* Gas → Liquid (condensation)
* Liquid → Solid (freezing)

Example: Ice melts into water, water boils to steam, and steam condenses back to water.

---

## **Section 10: Electricity and Materials**

Just like heat, electricity also interacts with materials differently.

---

### **Conductors and Insulators of Electricity**

#### 1. **Conductors:** Materials that allow electric current to pass.

   * Examples: Metals (copper, aluminum, silver).
   * Used in wires and circuits.

#### 2. **Insulators:** Materials that block electric current.

   * Examples: Rubber, plastic, glass, wood.
   * Used in switches, coverings, plugs for safety.

---

### **Importance of Conductors and Insulators**

* Electric wires are made of copper (conductor) covered in plastic (insulator).
* Switches use plastic casing to prevent shocks.
* Circuit boards use metals to carry electricity.

## Section 11: Air

Air is all around us. All living things need air to live. Air surrounds the Earth as a layer called the atmosphere.

### Composition of Air

Air is a mixture of gases and other substances. The two main gases in it are nitrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen forms more than three-fourths of air. Other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and water vapour are present in air as well. The amount of water vapour (moisture) in the air is known as the humidity of the air.

The table describes the different components of air and their importance.

#### Movement of Air—Wind

Air does not remain still. It moves all the time. Moving air is called wind. There are different types of wind. A gentle wind is called a breeze. A wind that blows very fast is called a gale. A strong wind that brings with it heavy rain and sometimes lightning is called a storm.

#### Why does wind blow?

Warm air is lighter than cold air. Therefore, when air at a place gets warmed by the heat of the Sun, the warm air, being lighter, rises. Cold air from nearby rushes in to take the place of the warm air. This movement of air is called an air current. Such a current results in wind.

#### Sea breeze and land breeze

Air currents in coastal areas result in the formation of sea breeze and land breeze.

#### Sea breeze

During the day, the land heats up faster than the sea. The air over the land becomes warm and rises. Cooler air from over the sea blows in to take the place of the warm air. The breeze that blows from the sea to the land during the day is the sea breeze. It usually sets in during the afternoon, bringing relief to coastal areas in summer.

#### Land breeze

At night, the land cools much faster than the sea. The sea remains warmer, and so the air over it warms and rises. Cooler air from over the land blows towards the sea to take the place of the warm air. The breeze that blows from the land towards the sea at night is the land breeze. Thus, at night, the direction of the wind is reversed.

#### Monsoon winds

In places near the equator, including India, the land warms up faster than the sea during the summer. The warm air over the land rises and cool air from over the ocean blows in carrying moisture. These winds that bring rain to the land are called monsoon winds. In winter, the monsoon winds reverse direction and blow from the land to the sea. They bring rain to some areas.

#### Ventilating homes and buildings

The air in closed spaces can have bad smells, smoke, dust and moisture. It can cause fungus to grow on walls. It can be unhealthy for us to breath such air. Therefore, it is important to allow stale air to escape and fresh air to enter homes and other buildings. This is called ventilation.

Have you seen small windows located at a height in large buildings and halls? These are ventilators. They allow warm, stale air to escape from a room. Cool air then blows in through the windows

#### Exhaust Fans and Cooling Devices Placement

- Exhaust fans are installed high up on walls in kitchens, bathrooms, factories and so on. They help to remove stale air from rooms.
- Fans, coolers and air conditioners are used to cool rooms. Coolers and air conditioners should be placed high up to allow cool air to sink down and circulate.

## During winters we observe some dew drops over the grasses and leaves in the morning. What causes the formation of dew drops?

Dew drops form because of **condensation**.

Here’s how it happens step by step:

1. **Cooling at night** – During winter nights, the ground, grass, and leaves lose heat quickly and become cooler.
2. **Air in contact cools down** – The air touching the cool surfaces also gets cooled.
3. **Reaching dew point** – If the air cools enough, it reaches a temperature called the **dew point**, where it can no longer hold all the water vapor.
4. **Condensation** – The extra water vapor in the air changes into tiny liquid water droplets on the cool surfaces like grass and leaves.

That’s why in the morning we see shiny **dew drops** on plants, especially during cold, clear nights when cooling is stronger.

## Compound are formed by mixing two or more substances in fixed proportion.

Let’s carefully break this down:

A **compound** is a pure substance that is made when **two or more elements** combine **chemically** in a **fixed proportion by mass**.

### Key points:

#### 1. **Fixed proportion** – The elements always join in the same ratio.

   * Example: Water (H₂O) is always made of 2 parts hydrogen and 1 part oxygen by atoms (or 1:8 ratio by mass).
   * No matter where you take water from (river, sea, or lab), the composition is the same.

#### 2. **Chemical bond** – In compounds, the elements are chemically bonded together (not just mixed), so they lose their individual properties.

   * Example: Hydrogen (a flammable gas) + Oxygen (a gas that supports burning) → Water (a liquid that puts out fire).

#### 3. **Difference from mixtures** –

   * Mixtures are just physical combinations, and their ratio can vary (like sugar in water, you can add more or less sugar).
   * Compounds have a **fixed composition** and new properties.

**Simple explanation**: Compounds are like a recipe where the ingredients must be added in the exact amount every time, otherwise the substance formed will not be the same.

## When a substance changes from liquid state to gaseous state, the speed of the particles of the substance decreases.

That statement is **incorrect**. Let me explain clearly:

When a substance changes from **liquid → gas** (this process is called **evaporation** or **boiling**):

* In the **liquid state**, particles are close together but can move around each other.
* When heat is supplied, the particles **absorb energy**.
* This extra energy increases their **kinetic energy (speed of movement)**.
* Once they have enough energy to overcome the attraction between them, they escape into the air as **gas particles**.

Therefore, **the speed of the particles actually increases**, not decreases, when a liquid changes to gas.

Example:

* In boiling water, steam particles move much faster than water particles in the liquid state.

### Which one is a chemical change?

1. Mixing salt and sugar
2. Mixing sand and sugar
3. Conversion of milk into curd
4. Boiling water

The correct answer is:

**3. Conversion of milk into curd** ✅

### Explanation of each option:

#### 1. **Mixing salt and sugar** –

   * This is a **physical change**.
   * No new substance is formed, and the salt and sugar can still be separated.

#### 2. **Mixing sand and sugar** –

   * Also a **physical change**.
   * Both remain unchanged and can be separated by physical methods (like dissolving sugar in water and filtering sand).

#### 3. **Conversion of milk into curd** –

   * This is a **chemical change**.
   * Microorganisms (lactic acid bacteria) convert lactose sugar in milk into lactic acid.
   * A **new substance with new properties** (curd) is formed, and this change **cannot be reversed**.

#### 4. **Boiling water** –

   * This is a **physical change**.
   * Water changes from liquid to gas (steam), but it is still water (H₂O).
   * No new substance is formed, and it is reversible by condensation.

The **conversion of milk into curd** is the only **chemical change** in the list.

### After dissolving sugar into pure water. Which one is true?

1. Increase in the weight of water
2. Increase in the density of water
3. Water becomes translucent
4. Water becomes opaque 

**2. Increase in the density of water** ✅

#### 1. **Increase in the weight of water** –

   * Not correct. The **weight of water alone** does not increase.
   * What actually increases is the **weight of the solution** (water + sugar).

#### 2. **Increase in the density of water** –

   * Correct.
   * When sugar dissolves, sugar particles go in between water molecules.
   * The mass of the solution increases while the volume increases only slightly, so the **density increases**.

#### 3. **Water becomes translucent** –

   * Not correct.
   * A sugar solution is **transparent** (clear), not translucent.

#### 4. **Water becomes opaque** –

   * Not correct.
   * Opaque means you cannot see through it, which is not the case for sugar solution.

**Final Answer: Water with dissolved sugar has higher density than pure water.**

### The capacity of a liquid to have definite volume enables it to change its shape as per the container. 

That statement is **False**. ✅

### Reason:

* A **liquid has definite volume**, but this property is not what makes it change its shape.
* Liquids change shape because their particles are **loosely packed and can flow**.
* The **definite volume** just means the amount of liquid stays the same.

Correct idea:

* **Definite volume** → liquid cannot be compressed much.
* **Indefinite shape** → liquid takes the shape of its container.

--- 

### Mass is the measure of how much material is contained in a matter.

That statement is **True** ✅

### Reason:

* **Mass** tells us how much **matter (material/substance)** an object contains.
* It does not depend on shape, size, or location (unlike weight, which changes with gravity).

Example:

* A stone has the same **mass** on Earth and on the Moon, but its **weight** is less on the Moon because gravity is weaker.

--- 

### Gasses do not posses any mass and volume.

That statement is **False** ❌

### Reason:

* **Gases do have mass** → If you fill a balloon with air, it becomes heavier than an empty balloon.
* **Gases do have volume** → They spread out and occupy the entire space of the container they are in.
* What gases lack is a **definite shape and definite volume**. They take both the **shape** and the **volume** of the container.

Correct statement:
**Gases have mass and volume, but neither definite shape nor definite volume.**

--- 

### Mixture contains definite proportions of two or more elements.

That statement is **False** ❌

### Reason:

  * A **mixture** is formed when two or more substances are physically combined.
  * In mixtures, the substances are **not in fixed proportions** — the ratio can vary.

    * Example: You can mix sugar and water in a little or a lot, and it’s still a mixture.

👉 The statement actually describes a **compound**, because compounds have elements combined in a **definite proportion by mass** (e.g., water = H₂O, always 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen).

✅ Correct statement:
**A mixture contains two or more substances in any proportion, not definite proportion.**

--- 

### Any massless particle that occupies space is considered to be matter.

That statement is **False** ❌

### Reason:

  * **Matter** is defined as *anything that has **mass** and occupies space* (has volume).
  * If something is **massless**, it cannot be considered matter.
  * Example:

    * **Air** is matter → it has mass and takes up space.
    * **Light (photons)** has no rest mass and does not occupy space → it is **not matter**.

✅ Correct statement:
**Matter must have both mass and volume.**

Do you want me to also explain the difference between **matter** and **non-matter** with examples?
