## **Section 1: Introduction to Water**

Water covers about **71% of Earth’s surface**. Most of this water (around 97%) is found in oceans and seas and is salty. Only about **3% is fresh water**, and out of that, less than 1% is available for humans, animals, and plants to use.

## **Section 2: Physical and Chemical Properties of Water**

### **Physical Properties**

  1. **State of Matter** – Water exists naturally in three states:

    * **Solid**: Ice, snow, glaciers.
    * **Liquid**: Rivers, lakes, seas, groundwater.
    * **Gas**: Water vapor in the air.
      This ability to exist in all three states makes water unique.

  2. **Boiling Point and Freezing Point** –

    * Freezes at **0°C** into ice.
    * Boils at **100°C** at sea level into steam.
    * These values change slightly with pressure (for example, water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes).

  3. **Color, Taste, and Odor** – Pure water is **colorless, tasteless, and odorless**, though in nature it often contains minerals and dissolved gases that give it slight variations.

  4. **Density and Ice’s Peculiar Property** – Water is heaviest at 4°C. Ice is less dense than liquid water, so it floats. This is crucial for aquatic life because ice forms at the top of lakes and rivers, insulating the water below and allowing organisms to survive in cold climates.

  5. **Universal Solvent** – Water dissolves more substances than any other liquid, earning it the title of **“Universal Solvent.”** This property allows nutrients and minerals to be transported in living organisms.

### **Chemical Properties**

  1. **Molecular Formula** – Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H₂O).
  2. **Polarity** – Water molecules are polar, meaning one end is slightly positive and the other slightly negative. This makes water excellent at dissolving salts, sugars, and many gases.
  3. **pH Level** – Pure water has a pH of **7**, making it neutral.
  4. **Reactivity** – Water reacts with many substances, for example:

    * With metals like sodium → producing hydrogen gas.
    * With carbon dioxide → forming carbonic acid.

## **Section 3: Sources of Water**

### **Natural Sources**

* **Rainwater** – Freshwater supplied by the water cycle.
* **Rivers and Streams** – Flowing bodies of freshwater.
* **Lakes and Ponds** – Standing bodies of freshwater.
* **Groundwater** – Stored in aquifers underground.
* **Glaciers and Icecaps** – Storehouse of the majority of Earth’s freshwater.
* **Oceans and Seas** – Largest water bodies, but salty.

### **Human-Made Sources**

* **Wells and Tube Wells** – Access groundwater.
* **Dams and Reservoirs** – Store water for drinking, irrigation, and electricity.
* **Canals** – Artificial waterways for irrigation and transport.
* **Desalination Plants** – Convert seawater into usable freshwater.

## **Section 4: The Water Cycle**

The **water cycle (hydrological cycle)** describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth’s surface.

### Steps in the Water Cycle:

1. **Evaporation** – Sun heats water bodies, changing liquid water into vapor.
2. **Transpiration** – Plants release water vapor through their leaves.
3. **Condensation** – Water vapor cools to form clouds.
4. **Precipitation** – Clouds release water as rain, snow, hail, or sleet.
5. **Infiltration and Runoff** – Water seeps into the ground (groundwater) or flows back into rivers and oceans.

This cycle ensures a **continuous supply of freshwater**. Without it, life would not be sustainable.
