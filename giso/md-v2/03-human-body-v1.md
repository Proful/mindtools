# **Human Body and Its Functioning**

---

## **Section 1: Introduction to the Human Body**

The **human body** is one of the most fascinating creations in nature. It is like a highly advanced machine, made up of different parts that all work together in harmony. But unlike machines built by humans, the human body can **repair itself, grow, and adapt**.

From the time a baby is born until old age, the human body undergoes continuous changes. Every second, millions of processes take place inside us — our heart beats, our lungs breathe, our stomach digests food, and our brain controls everything we do, even when we are asleep.

* The **respiratory system** supplies oxygen.
* The **circulatory system** carries this oxygen to all body parts.
* The **muscular system** uses this oxygen to move.
* The **nervous system** controls when and how muscles move.

---

## **Section 2: Levels of Organization in the Human Body**

Before learning about organs and systems, it’s important to understand how the body is organized from the **smallest unit (cell)** to the **largest (the whole body)**.

### **1. Cells – The Building Blocks of Life**

  * A **cell** is the smallest living unit of the body.
  * Our body has about **37 trillion cells**.
  * Different types of cells perform different jobs.

    * Example: **Red blood cells** carry oxygen.
    * Example: **Nerve cells** transmit messages.
    * Example: **Muscle cells** help in movement.

Just as bricks are needed to build a house, cells are needed to build our body.

### **2. Tissues – Groups of Cells**

When similar cells join together to perform a function, they form a **tissue**.

The human body has **four main types of tissues**:

1. **Epithelial tissue** – Covers body surfaces and lines organs (e.g., skin).
2. **Muscle tissue** – Helps in movement (e.g., biceps).
3. **Nervous tissue** – Transmits messages (e.g., brain and spinal cord).
4. **Connective tissue** – Supports and connects body parts (e.g., bone, blood, fat).

### **3. Organs – Groups of Tissues**

Different tissues combine to form an **organ**.

* Example: The **heart** is made of muscle tissue (to pump), connective tissue (to hold it together), and nervous tissue (to control heartbeat).

Other examples: **lungs, brain, stomach, kidneys**.

### **4. Organ Systems – Groups of Organs**

Organs do not work alone. Several organs together form an **organ system**.

* Example: The **digestive system** includes mouth, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, etc.
* Example: The **respiratory system** includes nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm.

### **5. The Whole Organism**

Finally, all organ systems together form the **human body**.
This organization can be summarized as:

**Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ System → Human Body**

# **Section 3: Skeletal System**

The **skeletal system** is like the **framework of a building**. Just as a house has beams and pillars to support it, the human body has bones to give it shape and structure. Without bones, we would be like a shapeless bag of muscles, skin, and organs.

The skeletal system is made up of **bones, joints, ligaments, and cartilage**. Together, these parts support the body, protect delicate organs, and help us move.

---

## **Functions of the Skeletal System**

1. **Support** – Bones form the rigid framework that supports the body and holds it upright.

   * Example: The backbone supports the body so we can stand.

2. **Protection** – Bones protect delicate organs inside the body.

   * The **skull** protects the brain.
   * The **rib cage** protects the heart and lungs.
   * The **backbone** (vertebrae) protects the spinal cord.

3. **Movement** – Bones act as levers and joints act as pivots. With the help of muscles, they enable us to walk, run, jump, and lift things.

4. **Production of Blood Cells** – Inside some bones is a soft tissue called **bone marrow**, which makes red blood cells (carry oxygen), white blood cells (fight infection), and platelets (help clotting).

5. **Storage of Minerals** – Bones store important minerals like **calcium** and **phosphorus**, which strengthen bones and can be released into the blood when needed.

---

## **Parts of the Skeletal System**

![skeletal](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-02-skel.jpg)

### **1. Bones**

* Adults have **206 bones**, while babies are born with about **270 bones**. As we grow, some bones fuse together.
* Bones are living tissue, not dead material. They can repair themselves if broken.
* The hardest substance in the body, **enamel**, is found on teeth (though teeth are not bones).

### **2. Joints**

![joints](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-03-joints.jpg)

Joints are places where two or more bones meet. They allow movement and flexibility.

Types of joints:

* **Ball-and-socket joints** – Allow movement in all directions. Example: shoulder, hip.
* **Hinge joints** – Allow movement in one direction only, like a door hinge. Example: knee, elbow.
* **Pivot joints** – Allow rotation. Example: neck joint (turning the head).
* **Gliding joints** – Allow bones to slide over one another. Example: wrist, ankle.
* **Fixed joints** – Do not move. Example: skull bones.

### **3. Ligaments**

![ligaments](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-04-ligaments.png)

* Strong, elastic tissues that connect **bone to bone**.
* They help stabilize joints.

### **4. Cartilage**

* Soft, flexible tissue found at the ends of bones and in places like the nose and ears.
* Prevents bones from rubbing against each other.

---

## **The Human Skeleton**

The human skeleton can be divided into two parts:

1. **Axial Skeleton (80 bones)** – Forms the central framework of the body. Includes:

   * Skull
   * Vertebral column (backbone)
   * Rib cage

2. **Appendicular Skeleton (126 bones)** – Attached to the axial skeleton, helps in movement. Includes:

   * Arms and legs
   * Shoulder girdle
   * Pelvic girdle

---

## **Important Bones in the Body**

* **Skull** – Protects the brain; made of 22 bones.
* **Spinal column (vertebrae)** – Made of 33 small bones stacked on top of each other. It protects the spinal cord and gives flexibility.
* **Ribs** – 12 pairs of ribs form a cage around the chest.
* **Femur** – The thigh bone; the longest and strongest bone in the body.
* **Humerus** – Upper arm bone.
* **Tibia and Fibula** – Lower leg bones.
* **Clavicle (collar bone)** – Connects the arm to the body.
* **Pelvis** – Large bone at the base of the spine, supports the lower body.

![skeletal](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-02-skel.jpg)

---

## **Bone Health**

To keep bones healthy and strong:

* Eat foods rich in **calcium** (milk, cheese, leafy vegetables).
* Get enough **vitamin D** (sunlight, fish, eggs).
* Do regular **exercise** to strengthen bones and muscles.
* Avoid accidents by protecting joints during sports.

---

## **Interesting Facts about Bones**

* The **smallest bone** in the body is the **stapes** in the ear.
* The **largest bone** is the **femur** in the thigh.
* Bones are **five times stronger than steel** of the same weight.
* Bones keep growing in length until around **18–20 years of age**.
* The **spinal column** is flexible enough to let us bend and twist.

---

# **Section 4: Muscular System**

The **muscular system** is what makes our body move. While bones provide structure, it is the **muscles** that pull and push those bones to create motion. Without muscles, we would not be able to walk, run, smile, or even blink.

The human body has **more than 600 muscles**, and they make up nearly **40–50% of our body weight**.

---

## **Functions of the Muscular System**

1. **Movement** – Muscles work with bones and joints to move body parts.

   * Example: Biceps and triceps in the arm help lift and lower objects.

2. **Posture and Stability** – Muscles hold our body upright and stabilize joints.

   * Example: Back muscles keep the spine straight.

3. **Circulation of Blood** – The **cardiac muscle** of the heart pumps blood throughout the body.

4. **Digestion and Organ Function** – Muscles in the stomach and intestines contract to move food along.

5. **Heat Production** – Muscles generate heat when they contract, keeping body temperature stable.

---

## **Types of Muscles**

There are three main types of muscles in the human body:

### **1. Skeletal Muscles (Voluntary Muscles)**

![voluntary](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-05-voluntary.png)

* Attached to bones by **tendons**.
* Responsible for voluntary actions (we can control them).
* Appear **striped or striated** under a microscope.
* Example: Biceps, triceps, leg muscles.
* Work in **pairs**: when one contracts, the other relaxes.

👉 Example:

* **Biceps contract** → arm bends.
* **Triceps contract** → arm straightens.

### **2. Smooth Muscles (Involuntary Muscles)**

![smooth](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-06-smooth.jpg)

* Found in walls of internal organs like stomach, intestines, and blood vessels.
* Work automatically without conscious control.
* Appear smooth, not striped.
* Example: Muscles in the digestive system that push food forward (peristalsis).

### **3. Cardiac Muscle**

![cardiac](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-07-cardiac.jpg)

* Found only in the **heart**.
* Involuntary muscle.
* Strong, rhythmic contractions pump blood around the body.
* Never gets tired (beats around 100,000 times a day).

---

## **How Muscles Work with Bones**

Muscles are attached to bones with **tendons**.

* When muscles contract, they **pull** the bones to create movement.
* Muscles cannot push, only pull. Therefore, they work in **pairs**.

Example:

* To bend the elbow: **Biceps contract**, pulling the forearm up.
* To straighten the elbow: **Triceps contract**, pulling the forearm down.

This teamwork is called **antagonistic muscle action**.

---

## **Voluntary vs Involuntary Muscles**

* **Voluntary muscles** – Under our control. Example: arm and leg muscles.
* **Involuntary muscles** – Work automatically without us thinking. Example: heart, stomach, intestines.

---

## **Muscle Health**

To keep muscles healthy:

* Eat foods rich in **protein** (milk, eggs, fish, beans).
* Exercise regularly (walking, running, sports).
* Stay hydrated.
* Stretch muscles to avoid cramps.
* Get enough rest and sleep.

---

## **Disorders of Muscles**

* **Muscle cramps** – Sudden, painful tightening of muscles due to dehydration or fatigue.
* **Muscular dystrophy** – Weakening of muscles (genetic condition).
* **Strains and sprains** – Overstretching or tearing of muscle fibers or ligaments.

---

## **Interesting Facts about Muscles**

* The **largest muscle** is the **gluteus maximus** in the buttocks.
* The **smallest muscle** is the **stapedius** in the ear, which helps control sound vibrations.
* The **strongest muscle** (by force) is the **masseter muscle** in the jaw, used for chewing.
* It takes **17 muscles to smile** and **43 muscles to frown**. So, smiling is easier!
* The **eye muscles** are the fastest and most active, moving more than 10,000 times a day.

---

# **Section 5: Digestive System – The Journey of Food**

The **digestive system** is the set of organs and processes that break down the food we eat into nutrients that the body can absorb and use for energy, growth, and repair.

Food gives us:

* **Carbohydrates** → energy
* **Proteins** → growth and repair
* **Fats** → stored energy and insulation
* **Vitamins & Minerals** → regulation of body functions
* **Water** → transport of nutrients and waste

But food is usually in a form that the body cannot directly use. That’s why digestion is essential.

---

## **Main Functions of the Digestive System**

1. **Ingestion** – Taking in food and drink.
2. **Digestion** – Breaking down food into smaller molecules (mechanical + chemical).
3. **Absorption** – Nutrients pass into the blood.
4. **Assimilation** – Cells use nutrients for energy, growth, repair.
5. **Egestion** – Removal of undigested food (faeces).

---

## **The Human Digestive System: Step-by-Step Journey of Food**

![digestive](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-08-digestive.jpg)

### **1. Mouth (Oral Cavity)**

  * The first step in digestion begins in the mouth.
  * **Teeth** break down food into small pieces (mechanical digestion).

    * Incisors → cut food.
    * Canines → tear food.
    * Premolars & molars → grind food.
  * **Saliva**, produced by **salivary glands**, mixes with food.

    * Saliva contains **amylase enzyme**, which starts breaking down starch into sugar.
  * The tongue helps in mixing food and pushing it into the throat.

👉 The food becomes a soft ball called a **bolus**.

---

### **2. Pharynx and Esophagus**

* After chewing, food passes into the **pharynx** (throat) and then into the **esophagus** (food pipe).
* A flap called the **epiglottis** closes over the windpipe, preventing food from entering the lungs.
* The esophagus uses **peristalsis** (wave-like muscle contractions) to push food down into the stomach.

---

### **3. Stomach**

  * A muscular, J-shaped organ where food is churned and mixed with digestive juices.
  * The stomach secretes:

    * **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)** → kills germs, creates acidic medium.
    * **Pepsin enzyme** → breaks proteins into smaller peptides.
    * **Mucus** → protects the stomach lining from acid.
  * Food is churned into a semi-liquid mixture called **chyme**.

👉 Example: A sandwich eaten at lunch is churned into chyme within 2–4 hours.

---

### **4. Small Intestine**

* The **most important part of digestion and absorption**.
* It is about **6 meters long** and divided into three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

**Digestive juices in the small intestine:**

  * **Bile** (from liver, stored in gallbladder) → breaks down fats into smaller droplets (emulsification).
  * **Pancreatic juice** (from pancreas) → contains enzymes:

    * Amylase → digests starch to sugar.
    * Lipase → digests fats into fatty acids and glycerol.
    * Trypsin → digests proteins to amino acids.
  * **Intestinal juice** → completes digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

**Absorption of nutrients:**

* Inner walls of small intestine have finger-like projections called **villi**.
* Villi increase surface area and absorb nutrients into blood and lymph.
* Glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals → absorbed into blood.
* Fatty acids and glycerol → absorbed into lymph.

---

### **5. Large Intestine**

* About 1.5 meters long.
* Main role: **Absorbs water and minerals** from undigested food.
* Harmless bacteria in the large intestine help in producing vitamins like **Vitamin K**.
* Waste material becomes semi-solid (faeces).

---

### **6. Rectum and Anus**

* The rectum stores faeces.
* Waste is removed from the body through the **anus**.
* This process is called **egestion** (not excretion – because excretion is removal of liquid/gaseous waste like urine and sweat).

---

## **Accessory Organs of Digestion**

![digestive accessory](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-09-digestive-accessory.jpg)

  1. **Liver**

    * Largest internal organ.
    * Produces **bile**, stored in the **gallbladder**.
    * Helps in fat digestion.
    * Also stores glycogen and detoxifies harmful substances.

  2. **Pancreas**

    * Produces **pancreatic juice** rich in enzymes.
    * Secretes **insulin hormone** which controls blood sugar levels.

  3. **Gallbladder**

    * Small organ under the liver.
    * Stores and releases bile when needed.

---

## **Mechanical vs Chemical Digestion**

* **Mechanical digestion** – Physical breakdown (chewing, churning).
* **Chemical digestion** – Enzymes and acids breaking food into molecules.
* Both types work together to ensure complete digestion.

---

## **Timeline of Digestion**

* Mouth: seconds to 1 minute.
* Esophagus: 5–10 seconds.
* Stomach: 2–4 hours.
* Small intestine: 3–6 hours.
* Large intestine: 10–12 hours.
* Total digestion: \~24–36 hours.

---

## **Disorders of Digestive System**

1. **Indigestion** – Improper breakdown of food; causes discomfort.
2. **Diarrhea** – Watery stools due to infection/food poisoning.
3. **Constipation** – Difficulty in passing stools due to lack of fiber.
4. **Ulcers** – Sores in stomach lining due to excess acid.
5. **Jaundice** – Liver infection; skin and eyes turn yellow.

---

## **How to Keep Digestive System Healthy**

* Eat a **balanced diet** (fruits, vegetables, fiber, water).
* Avoid overeating and junk food.
* Chew food properly.
* Exercise regularly.
* Wash hands before eating (to prevent germs).

---

## **Interesting Facts about Digestion**

* The stomach produces **2–3 liters of gastric juice daily**.
* Your **small intestine is longer than your height**.
* The liver performs **500+ functions**, not just digestion.
* If unfolded, the surface area of the small intestine would cover a **tennis court**.
* Digestion uses up about **10% of the body’s energy**.

---

# **Section 6: Respiratory System – Breathing and Gas Exchange**

Breathing is one of the most vital processes of life. We can live without food for weeks, without water for days, but without oxygen for only a few minutes. The **respiratory system** ensures that oxygen reaches every cell of the body and that waste carbon dioxide is removed.

---

## **Why Do We Need Oxygen?**

* Every cell in our body performs a process called **cellular respiration**.
* In this process, **oxygen** combines with **glucose** (sugar from food) to release **energy (ATP)**.
* Waste products formed: **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and **water (H₂O)**.

The equation for cellular respiration is:

$$
Glucose + Oxygen \; \rightarrow \; Energy (ATP) + Carbon dioxide + Water
$$

This energy is used for walking, thinking, pumping blood, digestion, muscle contraction – in fact, **all life processes**.

---

## **Main Functions of the Respiratory System**

1. **Breathing (Ventilation)** – Taking in oxygen (inhalation) and giving out carbon dioxide (exhalation).
2. **Gas Exchange** – Oxygen moves into the blood, carbon dioxide moves out.
3. **Transport of Gases** – Oxygen carried to cells, carbon dioxide carried to lungs.
4. **Cellular Respiration** – Energy release in mitochondria of cells.

---

## **Parts of the Human Respiratory System**

The human respiratory system is like a **network of airways, organs, and muscles** that work together.

![respiratory](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-10-respiratory.jpg)

### **1. Nose and Nasal Cavity**

* Air enters mainly through the nose.
* Nose has **hair and mucus** that trap dust, germs, and harmful particles.
* Nasal cavity warms and moistens the air.
* Smell receptors also present here.

👉 Breathing through the nose is healthier than breathing through the mouth.

---

### **2. Pharynx (Throat)**

* A muscular tube connecting the nose and mouth to the larynx.
* Both food and air pass through pharynx.
* Epiglottis ensures food goes to esophagus and air goes to trachea.

---

### **3. Larynx (Voice Box)**

* Located at the top of trachea.
* Contains **vocal cords** that vibrate to produce sound when air passes.
* Helps us speak, sing, and produce different tones.

---

### **4. Trachea (Windpipe)**

* A long tube carrying air from larynx to lungs.
* Surrounded by **C-shaped cartilage rings** that keep it open.
* Inner lining has mucus and cilia to trap dust and move it upward.

---

### **5. Bronchi and Bronchioles**

* Trachea divides into two **bronchi** (one for each lung).
* Each bronchus branches into smaller tubes called **bronchioles** inside the lung.
* Bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called **alveoli**.

---

### **6. Lungs**

* The **main organs of respiration**.
* Located in chest cavity, protected by ribcage.
* Left lung has 2 lobes, right lung has 3 lobes.
* Covered by a thin double membrane called **pleura**, which reduces friction during breathing.

---

### **7. Alveoli**

* Microscopic balloon-like sacs at the end of bronchioles.
* Each lung has about **300–500 million alveoli**.
* Provide a huge surface area for gas exchange (as large as a tennis court!).
* Oxygen diffuses into blood; carbon dioxide diffuses out.

---

### **8. Diaphragm and Intercostal Muscles**

* **Diaphragm**: Dome-shaped muscle at bottom of chest cavity.
* **Intercostal muscles**: Found between ribs.
* Both work together to expand and contract the chest, helping in inhalation and exhalation.

---

## **Mechanism of Breathing**

Breathing is an **involuntary process**, but we can also control it (like holding breath).

### **Inhalation (Breathing In)**

1. Diaphragm contracts and moves downward.
2. Intercostal muscles pull ribs upward and outward.
3. Chest cavity expands → pressure decreases.
4. Air rushes into lungs because external air pressure is higher.

---

### **Exhalation (Breathing Out)**

1. Diaphragm relaxes and moves upward.
2. Ribs move downward and inward.
3. Chest cavity reduces → pressure increases.
4. Air is pushed out of lungs.

---

## **Gas Exchange in Alveoli**

* Alveoli walls are very thin and surrounded by **capillaries**.
* **Oxygen** from inhaled air diffuses into blood.
* **Carbon dioxide** from blood diffuses into alveoli.
* Oxygen binds with **hemoglobin** in red blood cells to form **oxyhemoglobin**.
* Blood carries oxygen to all body cells.

---

## **Control of Breathing**

* The **medulla oblongata** in the brain controls breathing automatically.
* It detects **carbon dioxide level in blood**.
* When CO₂ rises, breathing rate increases.
* That’s why after running or exercise, we breathe faster.

---

## **Respiration vs Breathing**

* **Breathing**: Physical process of inhaling and exhaling air.
* **Respiration**: Cellular process where glucose is broken down with oxygen to release energy.

👉 Olympiad Trick: All respiration requires breathing, but breathing itself is not respiration.

---

## **Types of Respiration**

  1. **Aerobic respiration** (with oxygen)

    * Glucose + O₂ → Energy + CO₂ + H₂O
    * Produces a lot of energy.

  2. **Anaerobic respiration** (without oxygen)

    * Glucose → Energy + Lactic Acid (in humans)
    * Glucose → Energy + Alcohol + CO₂ (in yeast)
    * Produces less energy.
    * Happens in muscles during heavy exercise → causes muscle cramps due to lactic acid build-up.

---

## **Common Disorders of Respiratory System**

1. **Asthma** – Narrowing of airways → difficulty in breathing.
2. **Bronchitis** – Inflammation of bronchi due to infection/smoking.
3. **Pneumonia** – Infection of lungs by bacteria/virus.
4. **Tuberculosis (TB)** – Infectious disease caused by bacteria.
5. **Lung cancer** – Often due to smoking.
6. **Common cold** – Viral infection of nose and throat.

---

## **How to Keep Lungs Healthy**

* Avoid smoking and polluted air.
* Exercise regularly (increases lung capacity).
* Eat foods rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants.
* Practice breathing exercises (like yoga’s pranayama).
* Keep surroundings clean to reduce allergens.

---

## **Interesting Facts about Breathing**

* An average person breathes **12–20 times per minute**.
* In a lifetime, we breathe about **500 million times**.
* We inhale about **11,000 liters of air every day**.
* Right lung is bigger than left lung (left makes space for heart).
* Hiccups are caused by sudden contraction of diaphragm.

---

## **Quick Recap of Respiratory System**

1. Air enters nose → filtered and warmed.
2. Passes through pharynx, larynx, trachea.
3. Divides into bronchi → bronchioles → alveoli.
4. Gas exchange in alveoli: O₂ in, CO₂ out.
5. Oxygen carried by hemoglobin to cells.
6. Diaphragm and rib muscles control inhalation/exhalation.

👉 **Key Olympiad Point**: The ultimate goal of breathing is not just oxygen intake, but **energy release in cells**.

---

# **Section 7: Circulatory System – Transport of Blood and Nutrients**

The human body is like a busy city. Just as roads, vehicles, and signals keep a city moving, our body also has a complex transport network that carries oxygen, food, and other essentials to every cell. This system is called the **circulatory system** (or cardiovascular system).

It ensures:

* **Delivery of oxygen and nutrients** to cells.
* **Removal of wastes** like carbon dioxide and urea.
* **Transport of hormones** for coordination.
* **Defense against diseases** through white blood cells.
* **Maintenance of body temperature** and balance of fluids.

Without circulation, cells would die quickly, as they cannot move to get food or oxygen on their own.

---

## **Main Components of Circulatory System**

1. **Heart** – the pumping organ.
2. **Blood** – the transport fluid.
3. **Blood vessels** – the network of tubes (arteries, veins, capillaries).

---

## **The Heart – The Pump of Life**

The **heart** is a muscular organ located slightly to the left in the chest, protected by the ribcage.

* Size: about the size of a fist.
* Beats: about **70–80 times per minute** in adults.
* Pumps: around **5 liters of blood per minute**.
* In a lifetime: more than **2.5 billion beats**!

---

### **Structure of the Heart**

![heart](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-11-heart.jpg)

The heart is divided into **four chambers**:

1. **Right Atrium** – receives deoxygenated blood from the body.
2. **Right Ventricle** – pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs.
3. **Left Atrium** – receives oxygenated blood from lungs.
4. **Left Ventricle** – pumps oxygenated blood to entire body.

👉 Walls of ventricles are thicker than atria, since they pump blood with more force.
👉 The left ventricle has the **thickest wall**, because it pumps blood to the whole body.

---

### **Valves in the Heart**

  * Valves act like **one-way doors**.
  * Prevent backflow of blood.
  * Main valves:

    * **Tricuspid valve** – between right atrium and right ventricle.
    * **Bicuspid (mitral) valve** – between left atrium and left ventricle.
    * **Pulmonary valve** – between right ventricle and pulmonary artery.
    * **Aortic valve** – between left ventricle and aorta.

---

### **Circulation Pathway**

![circulatory](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-12-circulatory.png)

There are **two types of circulation**:

  1. **Pulmonary circulation (lungs)**

    * Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary vein → Left atrium.
    * Function: Exchange of gases (CO₂ out, O₂ in).

  2. **Systemic circulation (body)**

    * Left ventricle → Aorta → Body organs → Veins → Right atrium.
    * Function: Supply oxygen and nutrients to body cells.

👉 Together, pulmonary + systemic circulation = **double circulation** (a feature of humans and mammals).

---

## **Heartbeat**

  * Controlled by special cells in **sinoatrial (SA) node**, also called the **natural pacemaker**.
  * Sequence:

    1. Atria contract → push blood into ventricles.
    2. Ventricles contract → pump blood to lungs and body.
  * Heartbeat sound **“lub-dub”**:

    * **Lub**: Closing of atrioventricular valves (tricuspid & bicuspid).
    * **Dub**: Closing of semilunar valves (aortic & pulmonary).

Normal rate: **70–80 beats per minute** (higher in children).

---

## **Blood – The Transport Fluid**

Blood is a red-colored fluid that circulates throughout the body.

![blood](/Users/sanvi/all/code/github/mindtools/giso/md-v2/images/03-13-blood.png)

### **Composition of Blood**

  1. **Plasma (55%)**

    * Pale yellow fluid.
    * Mostly water, with proteins, hormones, salts, nutrients, and wastes.

  2. **Red Blood Cells (RBCs / Erythrocytes)**

    * Contain **hemoglobin** which binds oxygen.
    * Lifespan: \~120 days.
    * Produced in bone marrow.
    * No nucleus in humans (for more space for hemoglobin).

  3. **White Blood Cells (WBCs / Leukocytes)**

    * Defend body against infections.
    * Types: lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, etc.

  4. **Platelets (Thrombocytes)**

    * Help in blood clotting.
    * Prevent excessive bleeding during injury.

---

### **Functions of Blood**

* Transport oxygen (by hemoglobin).
* Carry carbon dioxide to lungs.
* Deliver nutrients (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids).
* Carry hormones to target organs.
* Regulate body temperature.
* Protect against infections.
* Heal wounds through clotting.

---

## **Blood Vessels – The Transport Network**

Blood flows through a vast network of tubes:

  1. **Arteries**

    * Carry blood **away from heart**.
    * Thick, elastic walls (withstand high pressure).
    * Mostly carry oxygenated blood (except pulmonary artery).

  2. **Veins**

    * Carry blood **towards heart**.
    * Thin walls, wider lumen.
    * Have **valves** to prevent backflow.
    * Mostly carry deoxygenated blood (except pulmonary vein).

  3. **Capillaries**

    * Microscopic thin-walled vessels.
    * Connect arteries to veins.
    * Site of exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and wastes between blood and cells.

## **Types of Circulation in Humans**

* **Pulmonary circulation** – Between heart and lungs.
* **Systemic circulation** – Between heart and body.
* **Coronary circulation** – Supply of blood to heart muscles themselves.
* **Hepatic portal circulation** – Blood from digestive organs passes through liver before returning to heart (important for nutrient processing).

---

## **Blood Pressure**

* The force exerted by blood on walls of arteries.
* Measured using **sphygmomanometer**.
* Normal: **120/80 mmHg** (systolic/diastolic).
* High BP = Hypertension.
* Low BP = Hypotension.

---

## **Disorders of Circulatory System**

1. **Anemia** – Low hemoglobin or RBC count.
2. **Leukemia** – Cancer of WBCs.
3. **Hemophilia** – Blood does not clot properly.
4. **Hypertension** – High blood pressure.
5. **Atherosclerosis** – Fat deposits clog arteries.
6. **Heart attack (Myocardial infarction)** – Blockage of blood supply to heart muscle.
7. **Stroke** – Blockage or bleeding in brain blood vessels.

---

## **How to Keep Circulatory System Healthy**

* Eat balanced diet (iron, vitamins, low fat).
* Exercise regularly (improves heart efficiency).
* Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol.
* Manage stress (yoga, meditation).
* Regular health checkups (blood pressure, cholesterol).

---

## **Interesting Facts about Circulation**

* Heart beats \~100,000 times per day.
* The total length of blood vessels in body is \~100,000 km (enough to circle Earth twice!).
* An adult body has about **5–6 liters of blood**.
* RBCs travel entire body in less than **1 minute**.
* Blood is red due to iron-containing hemoglobin.

---

## **Quick Recap of Circulatory System**

1. Heart pumps blood in double circulation: pulmonary (lungs) and systemic (body).
2. Blood carries oxygen, nutrients, wastes, hormones, and defenses.
3. Blood vessels: arteries (out), veins (in), capillaries (exchange).
4. Blood pressure shows force of blood on arteries.
5. Healthy lifestyle ensures a strong heart and clean vessels.

👉 **Key Olympiad Point**: The circulatory system links all other systems – without it, nutrients from digestion, oxygen from respiration, and wastes from excretion could not be transported.

# **Section 8: Nervous System – The Body’s Control Center**

The **nervous system** is the **communication network** of the body. It allows us to sense the world, think, feel, move, and maintain balance in all body functions. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to respond to our environment.

Just like a computer has a CPU (central processing unit), circuits, and input-output devices, our body has:

* **Brain** – the control center.
* **Spinal cord** – the main communication highway.
* **Nerves** – cables carrying messages.
* **Sense organs** – input devices.

2. **Processing & Integration** – Brain and spinal cord process information, decide what to do.
3. **Motor Output** – Sends commands to muscles and glands to act.
4. **Homeostasis Regulation** – Maintains balance in body functions like breathing, heartbeat, temperature.
5. **Mental Activities** – Thinking, memory, emotions, creativity, and problem-solving.

---

## **Parts of the Nervous System**

The nervous system has **two main divisions**:

    1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**

    * Brain + Spinal cord.
    * Main processing and control unit.

  2. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**

    * Nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
    * Connects CNS with the rest of the body.

---

## **The Central Nervous System (CNS)**

### **The Brain**

The **brain** is the most important and complex organ in the body.

* Weight: about **1.3–1.4 kilograms** in adults.
* Contains **about 86 billion neurons (nerve cells)**.
* Protected by the **skull**, three membranes called **meninges**, and a fluid called **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** that cushions it from shocks.

#### **Main Parts of the Brain**

  1. **Cerebrum** (largest part)

    * Divided into two halves: **left** and **right hemispheres**.
    * Surface is wrinkled with ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci).
    * Functions:

      * Controls voluntary movements.
      * Processes sensory information.
      * Responsible for thinking, reasoning, memory, language, and creativity.
    * Left hemisphere: logical, analytical, language.

  * Extends from the brainstem to the lower back.
  * Functions:

    * Relays messages between brain and body.
    * Controls **reflex actions** – quick, automatic responses (e.g., pulling hand away from a hot surface).

---

## **The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**

The PNS connects the CNS to limbs and organs. It is divided into:

  1. **Somatic Nervous System (SNS)**

    * Controls **voluntary actions** like walking, writing, speaking.
    * Transmits signals from brain → muscles.

  2. **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**

    * Controls **involuntary actions** like heartbeat, digestion, sweating, breathing rate.
    * Divided into:

      * **Sympathetic system** – “fight or flight” (prepares body in danger: increases heartbeat, widens pupils).
      * **Parasympathetic system** – “rest and digest” (calms body: slows heartbeat, aids digestion).

---

## **Nerve Cells – Neurons**

The basic unit of the nervous system is the **neuron**.

### **Structure of a Neuron**

  1. **Cell body (soma)** – contains nucleus and organelles.
  2. **Dendrites** – branch-like structures that receive signals.
  3. **Axon** – long fiber that carries signals away from the cell body.

    * Covered by a **myelin sheath** that speeds up messages.
  4. **Axon terminals** – transmit signals to other neurons, muscles, or glands.

### **How Neurons Work**

* Neurons transmit signals as tiny **electrical impulses**.
* Communication happens across a small gap called a **synapse**, where chemicals called **neurotransmitters** carry the message.

👉 In this way, billions of neurons form an amazing network inside our brain and body.

---

## **Sense Organs and the Nervous System**

Our **five sense organs** (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin) are closely connected to the nervous system.

# **Section 9: Excretory System – Removing Wastes from the Body**

Every living organism produces waste as part of its life processes. If waste is not removed, it can become toxic and harmful. The **excretory system** ensures that our body stays clean from unwanted and harmful substances.

Think of it as the **garbage disposal system** of the human body. Just as a city has dustbins, drainage pipes, and sewage treatment plants to handle waste, our body has specialized organs that collect and expel waste.

---

## **Why is Excretion Important?**

1. **Removes harmful substances** like urea, uric acid, carbon dioxide, and excess salts.
2. **Maintains water balance** (osmoregulation).
3. **Regulates blood pressure and volume**.
4. **Keeps the chemical composition of blood stable** (homeostasis).
5. **Prevents poisoning** – without excretion, toxins would build up and damage organs.

---

## **Organs of the Human Excretory System**

The human excretory system is mainly concerned with **liquid waste** removal. The major organs include:

1. **Kidneys** – the main filtering units.
2. **Ureters** – tubes that carry urine from kidneys to bladder.
3. **Urinary bladder** – stores urine temporarily.
4. **Urethra** – releases urine outside the body.

Additionally, other organs also help in excretion:

* **Skin** – removes salts, water, and urea through sweat.
* **Lungs** – remove carbon dioxide and some water vapor.
* **Liver** – breaks down toxins, old red blood cells, and excess amino acids.

---

## **The Kidneys – Natural Filters**

The kidneys are the **most important excretory organs**.

* Shape: Bean-shaped.
* Size: About 10–12 cm long in adults (like a fist).
* Location: One on each side of the spine, below the rib cage.
* Number: Humans normally have **two kidneys**, but a person can survive with just one.

### **Functions of the Kidneys**

1. Filter blood and remove wastes like urea and creatinine.
2. Maintain balance of salts (sodium, potassium, calcium).
3. Control water level in body (osmoregulation).
4. Regulate blood pressure by controlling fluid levels.
5. Produce hormones (like erythropoietin, which helps make red blood cells).

---

## **The Nephron – Structural Unit of Kidney**

Each kidney contains about **1 million nephrons**, which are tiny filtering units.

### **Parts of a Nephron**

1. **Bowman’s capsule** – cup-like structure that receives blood from arteries.
2. **Glomerulus** – a bunch of capillaries inside Bowman’s capsule where filtration occurs.
3. **Tubule** – long, coiled tube that reabsorbs useful substances like glucose, amino acids, and water.
4. **Collecting duct** – passes urine to renal pelvis → ureter.

👉 The nephron works like a **sieve + recycling plant**. It filters blood, throws away wastes, and reabsorbs useful substances back into the bloodstream.

---

## **Formation of Urine**

The process of making urine has three main steps:

1. **Filtration** – Blood enters the nephron, and waste products + water are filtered into Bowman’s capsule.
2. **Reabsorption** – Useful substances (glucose, amino acids, some water) are taken back into the blood.
3. **Secretion** – Extra salts and hydrogen ions are secreted into the tubule.

The final product is **urine** – a yellow liquid containing water, urea, and salts.

---

## **Urinary Tract**

1. **Ureters** – Thin muscular tubes (\~25 cm) carrying urine from kidneys to bladder.
2. **Urinary bladder** – A muscular sac that stores urine until full (capacity \~400–600 ml in adults).
3. **Urethra** – Tube that carries urine out during urination.

---

## **Other Organs that Help in Excretion**

  1. **Lungs**

    * Excrete **carbon dioxide** and some **water vapor** when we breathe out.

  2. **Skin**

    * Sweat glands remove water, salts, and small amounts of urea.
    * Also helps in **temperature regulation**.

  3. **Liver**

    * Breaks down excess amino acids → forms **urea**.
    * Removes **old red blood cells** → produces bile pigments.
    * Detoxifies drugs, alcohol, and harmful substances.

---

## **Excretory System and Homeostasis**

The excretory system works closely with other systems to maintain stability in the body:

* With the **circulatory system**: Kidneys filter blood and regulate pressure.
* With the **respiratory system**: Lungs remove CO₂ and balance blood pH.
* With the **integumentary system**: Skin removes excess water and salts.

---

## **Disorders of the Excretory System**

1. **Kidney Stones** – Crystals of calcium, uric acid, or salts block urine flow, causing severe pain.

* Wastes are removed, and clean blood is returned to the body.
* Dialysis must be repeated regularly to keep the patient alive.

In severe cases, a **kidney transplant** may be required.

---

## **Keeping the Excretory System Healthy**

* Drink plenty of water (6–8 glasses daily).
* Eat less salt and sugar.
* Avoid excessive junk food and carbonated drinks.
* Limit alcohol and smoking.
* Practice good hygiene to prevent UTIs.

* A single kidney has about **1 million nephrons**.
* The color of urine can tell about hydration – pale yellow = healthy, dark yellow = dehydration.
* Some desert animals (like kangaroo rats) hardly produce urine to conserve water.
* Sweat is mostly water (99%), but also contains salts and small amounts of waste.

---

## **Summary of the Excretory System**

* Excretion is the process of **removing wastes** from the body.
* Main organs: **kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra**.
* Kidneys filter blood through **nephrons** to produce urine.

# **Section 12: Immune System – The Body’s Defense System**

The **immune system** is the body’s **army of defense** against harmful invaders like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Without it, even a small cold could become life-threatening.

It is a **complex network of organs, tissues, and cells** that work together to protect us from diseases.

---

## **Functions of the Immune System**

1. **Recognizes harmful invaders** (germs, toxins, cancer cells).
2. **Destroys pathogens** before they cause illness.
3. **Remembers past infections** (immunity) to fight them faster next time.
4. **Repairs tissues** and heals wounds.
5. **Protects against abnormal cells** (like cancer).

---

## **Types of Immunity**

* Example: If you had chickenpox once, your immune system remembers it and protects you from getting it again.

---

### **3. Passive Immunity**

  * Temporary immunity received from another source.
  * Example:

    * Babies get antibodies from mother’s milk.
    * Ready-made antibodies given in injections for quick protection (like snake anti-venom).

---

## **Main Organs and Parts of the Immune System**

## **4. Glands of the Skin**

The skin contains two main types of glands:

### **A. Sweat Glands (Sudoriferous Glands)**

* Located in the dermis.
* Produce **sweat** (mostly water + salts + small amounts of waste).
* Sweat cools body during hot conditions or exercise.

### **B. Oil Glands (Sebaceous Glands)**

* Secrete **sebum** (oily substance).
* Keeps skin soft and waterproof.
* Prevents skin from drying out.
* Found mostly on face, scalp, chest, and back.

## **5. Functions of the Integumentary System**

* Acts as a **barrier** against infections, UV rays, and injuries.
* Helps **maintain body temperature** through sweating and blood flow control.
* Provides **sensations** (heat, cold, touch, pain).
* Aids in **excretion** of wastes through sweat.
* Stores **fat** for insulation and energy.
* Produces **Vitamin D** with sunlight exposure.

---

## **6. Common Problems of the Integumentary System**

* **Acne** – Blockage of oil glands.
* **Sunburn** – Skin damage due to UV radiation.
* **Dandruff** – Flaking of scalp skin.
* **Athlete’s foot** – Fungal infection of skin.
* **Skin cancer** – Abnormal growth of skin cells due to excess sun exposure.
* **Eczema** – Red, itchy, inflamed patches on skin.

---

## **7. Care of the Integumentary System**

* Bathe regularly to remove dirt and germs.
* Avoid sharing combs, towels, or razors.
* Use sunscreen to protect from UV rays.
* Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins (especially **Vitamin C, E, and A**).
* Drink enough water to keep skin hydrated.
* Avoid harsh chemicals and excessive cosmetics.

---

## **Amazing Facts about the Integumentary System**

* The skin renews itself every **28 days**.
* An average adult has about **5 million hair follicles**.
* Nails grow faster in summer than in winter.
* Sweat is **odorless**; body odor comes from bacteria feeding on sweat.
* Goosebumps occur when tiny muscles at hair follicles contract in cold or fear.

# **Section 15: The Excretory System – Removing Waste from the Body**

The **excretory system** is the body’s **waste removal system**. Just like a city has garbage collectors and sewage treatment plants, the human body has special organs that remove **harmful wastes** produced during daily activities. Without excretion, our bodies would get poisoned by these wastes.

---

## **1. Why Do We Need Excretion?**

Every time we eat food, breathe air, or move our muscles, our cells are busy producing **energy**. In this process, they also produce **waste materials** such as:

* **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** – waste gas from respiration
* **Urea and uric acid** – nitrogen wastes from protein digestion
* **Excess salts and water** – when the body has more than it needs
* **Heat** – generated during metabolism

If these wastes are not removed:

* CO₂ can make blood acidic.
* Urea can poison cells.
* Extra water and salts can disturb body balance.

Thus, the **excretory system maintains homeostasis** (balance inside the body).

---

## **2. Major Organs of the Excretory System**

The excretory system is made up of several organs working together.

### **A. Kidneys**

* The main organs of excretion.
* Bean-shaped, reddish-brown organs located on either side of the backbone.
* Each kidney is about the size of a fist.

**Functions:**

* Filter blood to remove urea, salts, and extra water.
* Produce **urine** (waste fluid).
* Maintain balance of water and minerals in the body.
* Produce hormones like **erythropoietin** (helps make red blood cells).

### **B. Ureters**

* Two thin tubes connecting kidneys to the bladder.
* Carry urine from kidneys to urinary bladder.

### **C. Urinary Bladder**

* A muscular sac that stores urine until it is released.
* Can hold about **400–600 ml** of urine in adults.

### **D. Urethra**

* A tube that carries urine from bladder to outside of the body.
* The process of releasing urine is called **urination**.

---

## **3. How Do Kidneys Work? – The Filtering Process**

Each kidney contains about **1 million tiny units** called **nephrons**. Nephrons are the actual filters.

**Steps of Filtration in Nephrons:**

1. Blood carrying waste enters nephron.
2. Wastes, salts, and water are filtered out.
3. Useful substances (like glucose, amino acids, water) are reabsorbed back.
4. The remaining fluid is **urine**, which contains water, urea, salts, and toxins.

---

## **4. Other Organs That Help in Excretion**

Excretion is not just the job of kidneys – other organs also help remove wastes:

* **Lungs** → Remove **carbon dioxide** and water vapor when we breathe out.
* **Skin** → Removes wastes like salts, urea, and water through **sweat glands**.
* **Liver** → Breaks down old red blood cells, detoxifies harmful chemicals, and converts ammonia into urea.
* **Large Intestine** → Removes solid wastes (undigested food).

---

## **5. Functions of the Excretory System**

* Removes harmful wastes from body.
* Maintains **water balance** (prevents dehydration or swelling).
* Maintains **salt balance** (controls blood pressure).
* Maintains **acid–base balance** of blood.
* Prevents poisoning of cells.

---

## **6. Common Problems of the Excretory System**

* **Kidney stones** – hard deposits of salts inside kidneys.
* **Urinary tract infection (UTI)** – bacterial infection in bladder/urethra.
* **Kidney failure** – when kidneys stop working; may need **dialysis** (machine filters blood).
* **Dehydration** – not enough water; makes kidneys stressed.

---

## **7. Care of the Excretory System**

* Drink plenty of water (6–8 glasses daily).
* Eat a balanced diet; avoid too much salt or junk food.
* Do not hold urine for too long.
* Maintain good hygiene to prevent infections.
* Exercise regularly to improve blood circulation.
* Avoid alcohol, smoking, and harmful medicines that damage kidneys.

---

## **8. Amazing Facts about the Excretory System**

* Kidneys filter about **50 gallons (190 liters) of blood every single day**.
* An adult produces about **1.5 liters of urine daily**.
* Each kidney has more than **1 million nephrons**.
* The color of urine can tell about health (dark yellow = dehydration).
* Even if one kidney is removed, the other can still do the job!
