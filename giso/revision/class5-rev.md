## üå± **SOIL EROSION AND CONSERVATION ‚Äì REVISION NOTES**

---

### **1. Introduction**

* **Soil = vital natural resource** supporting all life on land.
* Provides **nutrients, water, and a base for plant growth**.
* **Animals and humans** depend on plants ‚Üí indirectly depend on soil.
* Takes **thousands of years** to form, but can be destroyed quickly.
* Understanding **formation, importance, erosion, and conservation** is essential for sustainability.

---

### **2. How Is Soil Formed? (Pedogenesis)**

* Process takes **hundreds to thousands of years**.
* Begins with **weathering of rocks** ‚Üí smaller particles ‚Üí mixed with organic matter.

#### **A. Weathering of Rocks**

1. **Physical (Mechanical) Weathering** ‚Äì rocks break without changing composition.

   * Temperature change ‚Üí cracks.
   * Frost ‚Üí water freezes & expands in cracks.
   * Wind & water ‚Üí abrasion.
   * Roots & burrowing animals ‚Üí break rocks.
2. **Chemical Weathering** ‚Äì rocks change chemically.

   * Oxidation ‚Üí rusting.
   * Hydration ‚Üí minerals absorb water & expand.
   * Carbonation ‚Üí weak carbonic acid dissolves limestone.
   * Solution ‚Üí minerals dissolve in water.
3. **Biological Weathering** ‚Äì living things break rocks.

   * Roots, microbes, worms release acids or loosen rock particles.

#### **B. Addition of Organic Matter**

* Dead plants & animals ‚Üí decompose ‚Üí **humus** (rich organic layer).
* Humus improves **fertility, water retention, and soil structure.**

#### **C. Soil Profile (Layers of Soil)**

| Horizon | Name                | Description                         |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| O       | **Humus Layer**     | Decomposed leaves & organic matter. |
| A       | **Topsoil**         | Dark, fertile, root zone.           |
| B       | **Subsoil**         | Fewer humus, more minerals.         |
| C       | **Parent Material** | Large rock fragments.               |
| R       | **Bedrock**         | Solid rock base.                    |

### **3. Importance of Soil**

1. **Supports Plant Growth:** anchors roots, provides nutrients & water.
2. **Habitat for Organisms:** millions of bacteria, fungi, worms (‚Äúfarmers‚Äô friends‚Äù).
3. **Source of Minerals:** clay, mica, bauxite, sand for industry.
4. **Regulates Water:** absorbs rainfall, prevents floods, recharges groundwater.
5. **Supports Agriculture:** essential for crops & food supply.
6. **Part of Global Cycles:** carbon & nitrogen cycles maintain ecological balance.

---

### **4. What Is Soil Erosion?**

* **Wearing away & removal of topsoil** by wind, water, or human activity.
* Topsoil = **most fertile layer**, rich in humus & nutrients.
* Once lost ‚Üí takes centuries to rebuild.

---

### **5. Causes of Soil Erosion**

#### **A. Natural Causes**

* **Water erosion:**

  * *Sheet erosion* ‚Äì thin layer removed.
  * *Rill erosion* ‚Äì small channels form.
  * *Gully erosion* ‚Äì large trenches.
  * *Streambank erosion* ‚Äì riverbanks collapse.
* **Wind erosion:** blows away dry, loose soil (common in deserts).

  * *Example:* Dust Bowl, USA (1930s).

#### **B. Human Causes**

* **Deforestation:** roots removed ‚Üí loose soil.
* **Overgrazing:** animals strip grass cover ‚Üí bare land.
* **Poor farming practices:** over-ploughing, no crop rotation, steep slope farming.
* **Construction & mining:** disturb land & increase runoff.

---

### **6. Effects of Soil Erosion**

1. **Loss of Fertility:** nutrients in topsoil washed away.
2. **Reduced Crop Yields:** poor soil = less food.
3. **Silting of Rivers & Dams:** causes floods, reduces water capacity.
4. **Desertification:** fertile land turns barren.
5. **Habitat Destruction:** plants & animals lose homes.
6. **Water Pollution:** soil carries fertilizers/pesticides into water bodies.

---

### **7. Soil Conservation (Protection and Preservation)**

* **Goal:** prevent erosion & maintain fertility.

#### **A. Vegetation-Based Methods**

* **Afforestation/Reforestation:** plant trees ‚Üí roots bind soil.
* **Cover Crops:** grow grass or clover after harvest to protect topsoil.
* **Windbreaks/Shelter Belts:** tree rows reduce wind speed in farms.

#### **B. Farming Techniques**

* **Contour Ploughing:** plough along slopes, not up/down ‚Üí slows water.
* **Terracing:** cut slopes into steps to stop runoff (used in rice fields).
* **Strip Cropping:** alternate crop rows (e.g., maize + grass).
* **Crop Rotation:** different crops each season ‚Üí maintain nutrients.
* **Mulching:** cover soil with straw/leaves ‚Üí retain moisture & prevent erosion.
* **Controlled Grazing:** rotate animals between pastures.
* **Organic Farming:** compost instead of chemicals ‚Üí healthier soil life.

#### **C. Engineering & Water Control**

* **Check Dams/Embankments:** small barriers slow water, prevent gullies.
* **Watershed Management:** control rainfall flow & recharge groundwater.

---

### **8. Government & Community Efforts**

* **India‚Äôs Programs:**

  * *Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP)*.
  * *Soil Health Card Scheme* ‚Äì checks nutrient quality.
* **Awareness Campaigns:** educate farmers on sustainable practices.
* **Community Examples:**

  * *Chipko Movement* (tree protection).
  * *Green Belt Movement* (Kenya).

---

### **9. How Individuals Can Help**

* Avoid dumping waste or chemicals on soil.
* Plant trees & grass locally.
* Save water to reduce erosion from runoff.
* Compost kitchen waste instead of chemical fertilizers.
* Support reforestation & conservation projects.
