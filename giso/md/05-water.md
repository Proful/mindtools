## 1. 🌍 Introduction to Water

Water is one of the most important substances on Earth. It covers about **71% of the Earth's surface** and is vital for **all living organisms**. Without water, there would be no life. It is often called the **“universal solvent”** because many substances dissolve in it.

- **Chemical formula**: H₂O
- **States**: Found in **solid (ice)**, **liquid (water)**, and **gas (water vapor)** forms.
- Earth is the **only known planet** where water exists in all three states naturally.

## 2. 💧 Properties of Water

### a. Physical Properties

- **Color**: Pure water is **colorless**.
- **Taste**: Pure water is **tasteless**.
- **Odor**: Water has **no smell**.
- **Transparency**: Water is **transparent**; we can see through it.

### b. Chemical Properties

- **Boiling Point**: 100°C at sea level
- **Freezing Point**: 0°C
- **Solvent**: Water can dissolve many solids, liquids, and gases.

### c. Other Properties

- **Surface tension**: Water molecules stick together and form droplets.
- **Cohesion and adhesion**: Water sticks to itself and to other surfaces.
- **Density**: Ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats.

## 3. 🌧️ Sources of Water

Water is available from **natural** and **man-made** sources.

### a. Natural Sources

- **Rain** – Main source of freshwater
- **Rivers**
- **Lakes**
- **Streams**
- **Glaciers**
- **Underground water (aquifers, wells, springs)**
- **Oceans and seas** (contain saltwater)

### b. Man-Made Sources

- **Dams**
- **Reservoirs**
- **Tanks**
- **Canals**

### c. Freshwater vs Saltwater

- **Freshwater**: Drinkable, used for most purposes
- **Saltwater**: Not fit for drinking without desalination

---

## 4. ❄️ Forms of Water

Water exists in **three forms**:

| Form   | Description | Example             |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Solid  | Ice, snow   | Ice cubes, glaciers |
| Liquid | Water       | Rivers, lakes       |
| Gas    | Water vapor | Clouds, steam       |

---

## 5. 🌦️ The Water Cycle (Hydrological Cycle)

The **water cycle** shows how water moves through the environment in a continuous loop:

### a. **Evaporation**

Water from rivers, lakes, oceans turns into vapor due to the sun’s heat.

### b. **Condensation**

Water vapor cools down and forms clouds.

### c. **Precipitation**

Water falls back to the Earth as **rain, snow, sleet, or hail**.

### d. **Collection/Runoff**

Water collects in rivers, lakes, oceans, or goes underground.

### e. **Infiltration**

Some water seeps into the soil and becomes **groundwater**.

This cycle is vital to **maintain water levels** on Earth and support all life forms.

---

## 6. 🚰 Uses of Water

Water has **many uses** in different areas:

### a. Domestic Uses

- Drinking
- Cooking
- Bathing
- Washing clothes and utensils
- Cleaning homes
- Gardening

### b. Agricultural Uses

- Irrigation of crops
- Livestock care
- Soil moisture maintenance

### c. Industrial Uses

- Cooling machines
- Cleaning
- Processing raw materials
- Making products like paper, textiles, food items

### d. Environmental Uses

- Maintaining ecosystems
- Supporting plant and animal life
- Wetlands and natural habitats

### e. Recreational Uses

- Swimming
- Boating
- Fishing
- Water parks

## 7. 🏠 Water in Daily Life

We use water every day, often **without realizing how much**:

| Activity           | Approx. Water Used |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1 flush of toilet  | 6-10 liters        |
| 1 shower           | 15-30 liters       |
| Washing clothes    | 50-100 liters/load |
| Drinking water/day | 2-3 liters/person  |
| Washing dishes     | 10-15 liters       |

Water-saving habits are important in our daily life.

## 8. 🌾 Water in Agriculture

Water is crucial for **growing food**.

- **Irrigation methods**:

  - Drip irrigation (saves water)
  - Sprinklers
  - Canal irrigation

- **Problems**: Overuse can lead to **soil erosion**, **salinization**, and **depletion of groundwater**.
- **Solutions**: Smart irrigation techniques and rainwater harvesting.

---

## 9. 🏭 Water in Industry

Industries need water for:

- **Cooling systems** in power plants
- **Making products** (e.g., food, beverages, chemicals)
- **Cleaning machinery**
- **Hydropower generation**

However, **industrial waste** often pollutes rivers and lakes, making **water treatment necessary**.

---

## 10. 🐘 Water for Plants and Animals

### a. Plants

- Need water for **photosynthesis**
- Water transports minerals from the soil
- Lack of water leads to wilting and plant death

### b. Animals

- Drink water directly or get it from food
- Helps in digestion, temperature control, and removing waste
- Aquatic animals live entirely in water

---

## 11. 🧍 Water in Our Body

- The human body is **60–70% water**.

  - Removes waste through urine and sweat

Dehydration can lead to:

- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Dry skin
- Kidney problems

---

## 12. 🏭 Water Pollution
