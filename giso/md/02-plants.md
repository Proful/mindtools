## 🟩 1. Introduction to Plants

Plants are **living organisms** that grow in soil or water and use sunlight to make their own food through a process called **photosynthesis**. They form the foundation of most ecosystems and provide oxygen, food, shelter, and medicine.

### 🔹 Importance of Plants

- Produce **oxygen** during photosynthesis
- Provide **food** for animals and humans (fruits, vegetables, grains)
- Give **shelter** to birds, insects, and animals
- Prevent **soil erosion** with their roots
- Maintain **climate balance** by absorbing carbon dioxide
- Used to make medicines, furniture, clothing, and paper

## 🟩 2. Classification of Plants

Plants can be classified based on their size, structure, and habitat.

### 🔹 Based on Size and Structure

| Type         | Description                             | Examples               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Herbs**    | Small, soft, green stem, short lifespan | Tulsi, mint, coriander |
| **Shrubs**   | Small, bushy plants with hard stems     | Rose, hibiscus         |
| **Trees**    | Tall, big plants with thick woody stems | Mango, neem, banyan    |
| **Climbers** | Need support to grow, have weak stems   | Money plant, grapevine |
| **Creepers** | Grow along the ground, weak stems       | Pumpkin, watermelon    |

### 🔹 Based on Habitat

| Habitat     | Type of Plant                        | Adaptations                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Terrestrial | Grow on land                         | Roots grow deep, waxy leaves in deserts  |
| Aquatic     | Grow in or on water                  | Spongy stems, floating leaves            |
| Epiphytes   | Grow on other plants (non-parasitic) | Absorb moisture from air (e.g., orchids) |
| Parasitic   | Live on host plants and take food    | Dodder (Cuscuta), mistletoe              |

## 🟩 3. Parts of a Plant and Their Functions

### 🌱 3.1 Root

- Underground part of the plant
- Functions:

  - **Anchors** the plant in the soil
  - **Absorbs water and minerals**
  - Stores food (e.g., carrot, radish)

**Types of Roots:**

- **Tap Root**: One main root with smaller branches (e.g., carrot)
- **Fibrous Root**: A cluster of similar-sized roots (e.g., grass)

### 🌿 3.2 Stem

- Supports the plant and transports substances
- Carries water from roots to leaves
- Transports food from leaves to other parts
- Stores food in some plants (e.g., sugarcane)

### 🍃 3.3 Leaf

- Called the **food factory** of the plant
- Contains **chlorophyll** (green pigment)
- Performs **photosynthesis**
- Helps in **transpiration** (loss of water as vapor)
- Helps in **respiration**

**Parts of a Leaf:**

- Leaf blade (lamina)
- Midrib
- Veins

### 🌸 3.4 Flower

- Reproductive part of the plant
- Attracts pollinators
- Develops into fruit

**Parts of a Flower:**

- Petals, sepals
- Stamen (male part): anther, filament
- Pistil (female part): stigma, style, ovary

### 🍎 3.5 Fruit and Seeds

- Formed from fertilized flowers
- Fruit protects the seed
- Seeds grow into new plants (germination)

**Seed Parts:**

- Seed coat
- Cotyledons (store food)
- Embryo (baby plant)

## 🟩 4. Photosynthesis – How Plants Make Food

Photosynthesis is the process where green plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, and chlorophyll.

### 🔹 The Photosynthesis Equation:

`Carbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen`

### 🔹 Requirements for Photosynthesis:

- **Sunlight**
- **Water** (from roots)
- **Carbon dioxide** (from air through stomata)
- **Chlorophyll** (in leaves)

### 🔹 Products:

- **Glucose** (stored as food)
- **Oxygen** (released into air)

---

## 🟩 5. Germination

Germination is the process by which a seed grows into a new plant.

### 🔹 Conditions Needed:

- **Water** (activates enzymes)
- **Oxygen** (for respiration)
- **Warmth** (for enzyme action)

### 🔹 Stages of Germination:

1. Seed absorbs water
2. Seed coat breaks
3. Roots emerge
4. Shoot grows upwards
5. Leaves start photosynthesis

---

## 🟩 6. Reproduction in Plants

Plants reproduce in two main ways:

### 6.1 Sexual Reproduction (via seeds)

- Involves **male and female parts** of flowers
- **Pollination** → **Fertilization** → **Seed formation**

#### Pollination:

Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma

- **Self-pollination**: Same flower
- **Cross-pollination**: Different flower of same species

#### Fertilization:

Fusion of male and female gametes

### 6.2 Asexual Reproduction (no seeds)

- **By roots**: Sweet potato
- **By stems**: Potato (eyes), sugarcane
- **By leaves**: Bryophyllum
- **By spores**: Ferns, mosses

---

## 🟩 7. Adaptations in Plants

Plants adapt to survive in different environments.

### 🔹 Desert Plants:

- Thick stems (store water)
- Spines instead of leaves
- Waxy coating on leaves

### 🔹 Aquatic Plants:

- Floating leaves (lotus)
- Air chambers (water lily)
- Submerged leaves (hydrilla)

### 🔹 Mountain Plants:

- Needle-shaped leaves
- Sloping branches
- Thick bark

### 🔹 Rainforest Plants:

- Broad leaves
- Drip tips for heavy rain
- Climbing vines (lianas)

---

## 🟩 8. Interdependence of Plants and Animals

Plants and animals depend on each other for survival.

### 🔹 How Animals Depend on Plants:

- For food (herbivores)
- For oxygen
- For shelter

### 🔹 How Plants Depend on Animals:

- For **pollination** (bees, butterflies)
- For **seed dispersal** (birds, wind, animals)
- For **carbon dioxide** (needed for photosynthesis)

---

## 🟩 9. Seed Dispersal

Seed dispersal prevents overcrowding and helps plants grow in new places.

### 🔹 Methods:

| Method       | Example Plants        |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| By Wind      | Cotton, dandelion     |
| By Water     | Coconut, lotus        |
| By Animals   | Mango, apple, berries |
| By Explosion | Pea, balsam           |

### 🔹 Fiber Plants:

- Cotton, jute

### 🔹 Timber Plants:
