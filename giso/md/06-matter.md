## **1. Introduction to Matter**

### What is Matter?

- **Matter** is anything that has mass and takes up space (has volume).
- Everything around us—air, water, rocks, plants, animals, even your body—is made of matter.
- Matter can be **seen**, **touched**, **measured**, and **felt**.

### Properties of Matter:

| Property | Description                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mass     | The amount of matter in an object. Measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). |
| Volume   | The amount of space matter occupies. Measured in liters (L) or cm³.         |
| Density  | How tightly packed matter is. Dense objects feel heavier.                   |
| Weight   | Force due to gravity acting on an object’s mass. Measured in newtons (N).   |
| Inertia  | The resistance of matter to change in motion.                               |

## **2. States of Matter**

There are **three main states of matter** in everyday life: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.

### **A. Solids**

- Have **definite shape and volume**.
- Particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place.
- Examples: Ice, stone, book, wood.

### **B. Liquids**

- Have **definite volume but no definite shape**.
- Take the shape of the container they are poured into.
- Particles are less tightly packed than solids and can move around.
- Examples: Water, milk, oil, juice.

### **C. Gases**

- Have **no definite shape or volume**.
- Expand to fill any container.
- Particles are far apart and move freely.
- Examples: Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, steam.

### **D. Other States of Matter** (Advanced – for Olympiad Awareness)

- **Plasma** – Found in stars and lightning.
- **Bose-Einstein Condensate** – Exists at very low temperatures; particles behave as a single unit.

## **3. Changes in States of Matter**

### Physical Changes in State:

These are **reversible changes** where the matter changes its state without changing its composition.

| Process      | Description                                       | Example          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Melting      | Solid → Liquid (e.g., Ice melting to water)       | Ice → Water      |
| Freezing     | Liquid → Solid (e.g., Water freezing to ice)      | Water → Ice      |
| Evaporation  | Liquid → Gas (e.g., Water turning into vapor)     | Water → Steam    |
| Condensation | Gas → Liquid (e.g., Steam forming water droplets) | Steam → Water    |
| Sublimation  | Solid → Gas without becoming liquid               | Camphor, Dry Ice |
| Deposition   | Gas → Solid without becoming liquid               | Frost forming    |

## **4. Materials and Their Types**

Materials are substances that things are made from. Different materials have different properties, making them suitable for different uses.

### **Classification of Materials:**

#### A. **Natural Materials**

- Found in nature.
- Examples: Wood, wool, cotton, leather, water, stone, iron ore.

#### B. **Man-Made (Synthetic) Materials**

- Made by humans from natural substances or chemicals.
- Examples: Plastic, nylon, glass, steel, concrete.

## **5. Properties of Materials**

Understanding material properties helps in selecting the right one for different purposes.

### **A. Appearance**

- Materials can be **shiny (lustrous)** like metals or **dull** like wood.

### **B. Hardness and Softness**

- **Hard materials**: Cannot be easily scratched (e.g., steel, glass).
- **Soft materials**: Can be compressed or scratched easily (e.g., cotton, clay).

### **C. Transparency**

| Type        | Description                          | Examples                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Transparent | Light passes through completely      | Glass, clean water       |
| Translucent | Allows some light to pass through    | Frosted glass, wax paper |
| Opaque      | Does not allow light to pass through | Wood, metal, stone       |

### **D. Solubility**

- **Soluble**: Dissolves in water (salt, sugar).
- **Insoluble**: Does not dissolve (sand, oil).

### **E. Floatation**

- Some materials **float** in water (wood, plastic).
- Others **sink** (stone, metal).

### **F. Flexibility**

- Materials like rubber and cloth can bend easily.
- Materials like glass or ceramic are rigid and break if bent.

### **G. Thermal Conductivity**

- **Good conductors** (metals) allow heat to pass through.
- **Poor conductors** or **insulators** (wood, plastic) do not.

### **H. Electrical Conductivity**

- **Conductors**: Allow electricity to pass (copper, iron).
- **Insulators**: Do not conduct electricity (rubber, glass).

## **6. Uses of Materials Based on Properties**

### Examples:

| Material | Property                      | Use                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Glass    | Transparent                   | Windows, lenses                 |
| Wood     | Strong, insulator             | Furniture, building materials   |
| Cotton   | Soft, breathable              | Clothes, bedding                |
| Iron     | Strong, hard                  | Machines, tools, buildings      |
