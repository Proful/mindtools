## üåø PART 1: THE ENVIRONMENT

### 1.1 What is the Environment?

The environment is everything that surrounds us ‚Äî **air, water, soil, plants, animals**, and even buildings and vehicles. It includes both **natural** elements like forests, rivers, and mountains and **man-made** components such as cities and roads.

The environment provides everything we need:

- **Air to breathe**
- **Water to drink**
- **Food to eat**
- **Materials to build shelter**

The environment is divided into two main parts:

#### a. **Natural Environment**

- Comprises **biotic (living)** and **abiotic (non-living)** components.
- Examples: Forests, mountains, rivers, oceans, soil, sunlight, air.

#### b. **Human-made Environment**

- Includes human creations and modifications.
- Examples: Buildings, roads, vehicles, dams, bridges.

### 1.2 Components of the Environment

| Component       | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atmosphere**  | Layer of gases surrounding the Earth.            |
| **Hydrosphere** | All the water bodies (oceans, rivers, lakes).    |
| **Lithosphere** | The Earth's crust including rocks and soil.      |
| **Biosphere**   | Zone of life on Earth (plants, animals, humans). |

---

### 1.3 Importance of the Environment

- Supports **life** on Earth.
- Maintains the **balance** of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.
- Regulates **climate and temperature**.
- Provides **natural resources**: water, food, fuel, minerals.
- Ensures **ecosystem balance** through the food chain and cycles (like the water cycle and nitrogen cycle).

---

### 1.4 Environmental Problems

Due to human activities, our environment is facing many challenges:

#### a. **Pollution**

- **Air Pollution**: From vehicles, factories, burning of fuels.
- **Water Pollution**: From industrial waste, sewage, plastics.
- **Land Pollution**: Due to littering, dumping garbage, pesticides.
- **Noise Pollution**: Caused by horns, machines, loudspeakers.

#### b. **Deforestation**

- Cutting down forests for farming or construction.
- Leads to **soil erosion**, **loss of biodiversity**, and **climate change**.

#### c. **Global Warming**

- Caused by the increase of greenhouse gases like CO‚ÇÇ.
- Leads to melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather.

#### d. **Loss of Biodiversity**

- Animals and plants are going extinct due to habitat destruction and pollution.

---

### 1.5 Conservation of Environment

To save our environment, we must take responsibility through:

#### a. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**

- **Reduce** waste.
- **Reuse** items instead of throwing them.
- **Recycle** materials like paper, plastic, and metal.

#### b. **Afforestation**

- Planting more trees helps reduce CO‚ÇÇ and improve air quality.

#### c. **Save Water and Electricity**

- Fix leaks, turn off taps and lights when not in use.

#### d. **Use Public Transport**

- Reduces pollution and traffic.

#### e. **Use Eco-friendly Products**

- Avoid plastic, use biodegradable materials.

## ‚ö° PART 2: NATURAL CALAMITIES (NATURAL DISASTERS)

### 2.1 What are Natural Calamities?

Natural calamities are **sudden events caused by natural forces** that can cause **loss of life, injury, and damage to property and the environment**.

They include:

- **Earthquakes**
- **Floods**
- **Cyclones**
- **Tsunamis**
- **Volcanoes**
- **Droughts**
- **Landslides**
- **Forest Fires**

---

### 2.2 Types of Natural Calamities and Their Causes

#### a. **Earthquakes**

- Sudden shaking of the ground due to movements of Earth‚Äôs tectonic plates.
- **Causes**: Movement along faults, volcanic activity.
- **Effects**: Building collapse, loss of life, landslides, tsunamis.
- **Safety Tips**:

  - Take cover under a sturdy table.
  - Stay away from glass and heavy objects.
  - Move to open ground after shaking stops.

---

#### b. **Floods**

- Overflow of water on land that is normally dry.
- **Causes**:

  - Heavy rainfall
  - Dam failure
  - River overflow
  - Poor drainage

- **Effects**: Damage to crops, homes, roads, and loss of life.
- **Precautions**:

  - Move to higher ground.
  - Boil water before drinking.
  - Do not touch electric equipment when wet.

---

#### c. **Cyclones (Hurricanes, Typhoons)**

- Violent circular storms with strong winds and heavy rain.
- Form over warm ocean waters.
- **Causes**: Low pressure area in atmosphere.
- **Effects**: Destruction of buildings, flooding, trees uprooted.
- **Precautions**:

  - Stay indoors.
  - Stock up on emergency supplies.
  - Listen to weather updates.

---

#### d. **Tsunamis**

- Giant sea waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea.
- **Effects**: Coastal flooding, destruction of buildings, drowning.
- **Precautions**:

  - Move away from the coast immediately after an earthquake.
  - Follow tsunami warning alerts.

---

#### e. **Volcanic Eruptions**

- Eruption of magma, gases, and ash from Earth‚Äôs crust.
- **Effects**:

  - Lava destroys everything in its path.
  - Ash clouds affect air travel and health.
  - Can cause secondary hazards like fires or floods.

---

#### f. **Drought**

- Long period without rainfall.
- **Causes**:

  - Climate change
  - Deforestation
  - Overuse of groundwater

- **Effects**:
