# **Year 5 Science Olympiad – Course Module: Work, Force, and Energy**
---

## **1. Introduction to Force, Work, and Energy**

The concepts of **force**, **work**, and **energy** are fundamental in science, especially in understanding how things move, change shape, or function. These concepts are all around us—from lifting schoolbags, riding bicycles, flying airplanes, to even blinking our eyes.

In this module, we will explore:

- What is force?
- Types of force and their effects.
- What is work?
- Conditions for work to be done.
- Measuring work.
- What is energy?
- Types and sources of energy.
- Transformation and conservation of energy.

## **2. What is Force?**

### **Definition:**

A **force** is a **push** or a **pull** on an object. It is something that can make an object move, stop, change direction, change speed, or even change shape.

### **Examples of Force in Daily Life:**

- Pushing a swing.
- Pulling a drawer.
- Lifting a schoolbag.
- Kicking a football.
- Stretching a rubber band.

### **Effects of Force:**

A force can:

1. **Move** a stationary object.
2. **Stop** a moving object.
3. **Change** the speed of a moving object.
4. **Change** the direction of a moving object.
5. **Change** the shape or size of an object.

### **Types of Force:**

#### **a) Contact Forces:**

These are forces that act only when two objects are touching each other.

- **Muscular Force:** Force applied using body muscles (e.g., lifting, pulling).
- **Frictional Force:** The force that opposes motion when two surfaces rub against each other.
- **Applied Force:** Any force applied by a person or object.

#### **b) Non-contact Forces:**

These act even when objects are not touching.

- **Gravitational Force:** The force that pulls objects towards Earth.
- **Magnetic Force:** The force exerted by magnets on certain materials.
- **Electrostatic Force:** The force between charged particles.

---

## **3. Balanced and Unbalanced Forces**

### **Balanced Forces:**

When two equal forces act in opposite directions, they cancel each other out. The object remains still or continues moving at the same speed.

- Example: A book lying on a table.

### **Unbalanced Forces:**

When one force is stronger than the other, it causes movement or change in motion.

- Example: A tug of war where one team pulls harder.

---

## **4. What is Work?**

### **Definition:**

In science, **work is said to be done when a force is applied to an object and the object moves in the direction of the force**.

**Work is NOT done** if:

- No movement happens.
- Movement is not in the direction of force.

### **Examples of Work:**

- Pushing a trolley and it moves.
- Lifting a bag.
- A horse pulling a cart.

### **Examples where Work is NOT Done (scientifically):**

- Holding a heavy bag still.
- Pushing a wall that doesn’t move.

---

## **5. Conditions for Work to Be Done**

1. **Force must be applied.**
2. **Object must move.**
3. **Movement must be in the direction of the force.**

### **Work Formula:**

Although not always required in Year 5, it helps to know the basic formula:

$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance moved in direction of force}
$$

## **6. What is Energy?**

### **Definition:**

**Energy** is the **ability to do work**. Without energy, no work can be done.

Everything we do needs energy:

- Running,
- Thinking,
- Eating,
- Playing instruments.

---

## **7. Forms of Energy**

There are various forms of energy, each useful in different ways:

### **a) Mechanical Energy:**

Energy possessed by an object due to its motion or position.

- **Kinetic Energy** (energy of motion): Moving car, running child.
- **Potential Energy** (energy of position): Water stored in a dam, stretched bow.

### **b) Heat Energy (Thermal Energy):**

Produced when particles of matter move. It can change the temperature of substances.

- Example: Sun, fire, heaters.

### **c) Light Energy:**

Comes from luminous objects (those that give off light).

- Example: Sun, bulbs, fireflies.

### **d) Sound Energy:**

Produced by vibrating objects.

- Example: Guitar strings, human voice, drums.

### **e) Chemical Energy:**

Stored in substances and released during a chemical reaction.

- Example: Food, batteries, fuels.

### **f) Electrical Energy:**

Energy from the flow of electric current.

- Example: Fans, refrigerators, mobile phones.

### **g) Nuclear Energy:**

Stored in the nucleus of atoms. It is released during nuclear reactions (taught at higher grades, but good to know).

---

## **8. Sources of Energy**

### **Natural Sources:**

- **Sun:** Main source of all energy on Earth.
- **Wind:** Used to generate electricity.
- **Water:** Flowing water drives turbines to generate hydroelectricity.
- **Fossil Fuels:** Coal, oil, and natural gas.

### **Man-made Sources:**

- **Batteries**
- **Generators**
- **Power plants**

---

## **9. Renewable and Non-renewable Energy Sources**

### **Renewable Sources:**

Can be reused, naturally replenished.

- Sunlight
- Wind
- Water
- Biomass
- Geothermal

### **Non-renewable Sources:**

Available in limited quantities and cannot be quickly replaced.

- Coal
- Petroleum
- Natural gas

---

## **10. Transformation of Energy**

Energy can change from one form to another.

### **Examples:**

- Electric fan: Electrical → Mechanical
- Bulb: Electrical → Light + Heat
- Car: Chemical (fuel) → Mechanical + Heat
- Solar panel: Light → Electrical

This transformation makes energy useful in real life.

---

## **11. Conservation of Energy**

**Law of Conservation of Energy:**
Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be **transformed** from one form to another.

- The total energy in the universe remains constant.
- We must use energy wisely to avoid wastage.

### **Ways to Conserve Energy:**

- Turn off lights and fans when not in use.
- Use energy-efficient appliances.
- Use public transport or carpooling.
- Use renewable energy like solar panels.

---

## **12. Machines and Work**

### **What are Simple Machines?**

Tools that make work easier by changing the direction or amount of force needed.

Types of simple machines:

- **Lever** (see-saw)
- **Pulley** (wells)
- **Inclined Plane** (ramp)
- **Wedge** (knife)
- **Screw** (bottle cap)
- **Wheel and Axle** (bicycle)

Machines reduce effort and save time.

## **13. Friction – A Force That Affects Work**

### **Friction:**

The force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact.

### **Effects of Friction:**

- Slows down motion.
- Produces heat.
- Wears out materials.

### **Examples:**

- Rubbing hands together.
- Tyres on road.
- Brakes in vehicles.

### **Reducing Friction:**

- Using lubricants like oil or grease.
- Using wheels or ball bearings.

---

## **14. Gravity – A Force That Pulls Us Down**

### **Gravity:**

A natural force that pulls objects toward the center of the Earth.

- Keeps us grounded.
- Causes objects to fall.
- Helps rain fall and rivers flow.

### **Examples:**

- Dropping a pencil.
- Apple falling from tree.
- Jumping and coming back down.

---

## **15. Fun Facts and Trivia**

- The unit of work is **Joule** (named after James Prescott Joule).
- The **Sun** is 1.3 million times the size of Earth and supplies almost all energy to life on Earth.
- Without **gravity**, we would float into space!
- Even plants need energy from the sun to make food (photosynthesis).
