# 🐾 ANIMALS – EXPANDED THEORY FOR YEAR 5 SCIENCE OLYMPIAD
---

## 🧠 1. What Are Animals?

Animals are **living beings** that differ from plants in several important ways:

- They **cannot make their own food** through photosynthesis.
- They **move** from place to place (locomotion).
- They have **sense organs** to feel their surroundings.
- Most have a **nervous system** and **muscles** for quick reactions.

### Key Features of Animals:

| Feature           | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Cell Type         | Eukaryotic (complex cells with nucleus)   |
| Cell Structure    | Multicellular, no cell wall               |
| Movement          | Most animals can move (except sponges)    |
| Nutrition         | Heterotrophic (depend on other organisms) |
| Growth & Response | Grow in size, respond to stimuli          |
| Reproduction      | Mostly sexual, some asexual (e.g. Hydra)  |

## 🧬 2. Classification of Animals

To make it easier to study animals, scientists classify them based on:

- **Body structure**
- **Presence of backbone**
- **Method of reproduction**
- **Type of habitat**
- **Food habits**

### Main Divisions:

1. **Vertebrates** – animals with a backbone
2. **Invertebrates** – animals without a backbone

---

## 🦴 3. Vertebrates (Animals with Backbone)

Vertebrates have an **internal skeleton** made of bone or cartilage and a backbone that protects their spinal cord. There are **5 major classes**:

---

### 🐶 A. Mammals

**Examples**: Human, Dog, Cat, Whale, Bat
**Key Features**:

- Warm-blooded
- Give birth to live young (except platypus and echidna)
- Have hair or fur
- Females have **mammary glands** to feed milk

**Special Cases**:

- **Bats** are the only mammals that can fly.
- **Whales and dolphins** live in water but breathe air.

---

### 🦅 B. Birds

**Examples**: Pigeon, Eagle, Ostrich, Penguin
**Key Features**:

- Warm-blooded
- Have feathers
- Lay hard-shelled eggs
- Most can fly (except flightless birds like ostrich)

**Special Adaptations**:

- Hollow bones for flying
- Beaks adapted to diet (e.g., eagles have sharp beaks for meat)

---

### 🐍 C. Reptiles

**Examples**: Snake, Lizard, Crocodile, Tortoise
**Key Features**:

- Cold-blooded
- Dry, scaly skin
- Lay soft-shelled eggs on land
- Breathe through lungs

**Interesting Fact**: Snakes shed their skin regularly as they grow.

---

### 🐸 D. Amphibians

**Examples**: Frog, Toad, Salamander
**Key Features**:

- Cold-blooded
- Live part of life in water, part on land
- Moist skin for breathing along with lungs
- Lay jelly-like eggs in water

**Life Cycle**: Undergo **metamorphosis** (egg → tadpole → adult frog)

---

### 🐠 E. Fish

**Examples**: Goldfish, Shark, Tuna
**Key Features**:

- Cold-blooded
- Live entirely in water
- Use gills to breathe oxygen from water
- Fins for swimming and balance
- Scales cover the body

---

## 🐜 4. Invertebrates (No Backbone)

Invertebrates make up **more than 90%** of all animal species. They are generally **smaller**, have **simpler body structures**, and lack internal skeletons.

---

### A. Insects

**Examples**: Ant, Bee, Butterfly, Mosquito
**Key Features**:

- 3 body parts: head, thorax, abdomen
- 6 legs, 2 antennae, often 2 pairs of wings
- Undergo metamorphosis (complete or incomplete)

---

### B. Arachnids

**Examples**: Spider, Scorpion, Tick
**Key Features**:

- 8 legs, 2 body parts (cephalothorax and abdomen)
- No wings or antennae
- Some have venom

---

### C. Mollusks

**Examples**: Snail, Octopus, Squid
**Key Features**:

- Soft bodies, many with shells
- Move with muscular foot or tentacles
- Eyes are often well-developed

---

### D. Annelids

**Examples**: Earthworm, Leech
**Key Features**:

- Long, segmented body
- Breathe through skin
- Important for soil health

---

### E. Echinoderms

**Examples**: Starfish, Sea Urchin
**Key Features**:

- Spiny skin
- Radial symmetry
- Live only in sea

---

## 🌱 5. Animal Habitats

A **habitat** is the place where an animal lives and gets everything it needs: food, water, shelter, and mates.

### Types of Habitats:

| Habitat      | Example Animals   | Features                               |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Forest       | Tiger, Monkey     | Dense vegetation, seasonal changes     |
| Desert       | Camel, Fennec Fox | Hot, dry, sandy; water is scarce       |
| Grassland    | Zebra, Lion       | Open, few trees, many herbivores       |
| Polar Region | Polar Bear, Seal  | Cold, icy; thick fur or blubber needed |
| Ocean        | Shark, Whale      | Saltwater; streamlined bodies          |
| Freshwater   | Frog, Fish        | Rivers, ponds, lakes; oxygenated water |

---

## 🐾 6. Adaptations

**Adaptation** is a special feature that helps an animal survive in its habitat.

### Types of Adaptations:

1. **Structural**: Body parts (e.g., camel's hump)
2. **Behavioral**: Actions (e.g., hibernation)
3. **Physiological**: Internal functions (e.g., sweating)

---

### Examples:

- **Camel**: Long eyelashes, hump for fat storage, wide feet
- **Penguin**: Flippers, fat layer, black-and-white camouflage
- **Chameleon**: Changes color, long sticky tongue
- **Arctic Fox**: Small ears, thick fur for warmth
- **Fish**: Gills, fins, slippery body

## 🍽️ 7. Food Habits of Animals

Animals are categorized by their **feeding habits**:

| Type       | Examples       | Teeth Adaptation                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Herbivores | Cow, Deer      | Flat teeth for grinding           |
| Carnivores | Lion, Tiger    | Sharp teeth and claws             |
| Omnivores  | Bear, Human    | Both sharp and flat teeth         |
| Scavengers | Vulture, Hyena | Eat dead animals                  |
| Parasites  | Tick, Lice     | Live on other animals, suck blood |

---

## 🧪 8. Digestive Systems

The digestive system of animals varies based on their diet:

- **Herbivores**: Long intestine to digest cellulose
- **Carnivores**: Strong stomach acid to digest meat
- **Ruminants (like cows)**: Four-chambered stomachs for fermentation

---

## 🔁 9. Life Cycles & Reproduction

### A. Oviparous – Animals that lay eggs

Examples: Bird, Fish, Reptile

### B. Viviparous – Animals that give birth to live young

Examples: Humans, Cats, Dogs

---

### Metamorphosis

**Complete metamorphosis** (e.g., Butterfly):
Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult

**Incomplete metamorphosis** (e.g., Grasshopper):
Egg → Nymph → Adult

---
