When two equal forces act in opposite directions, they cancel each other out. The object remains still or continues moving at the same speed.

- Example: A book lying on a table.

### **Unbalanced Forces:**

When one force is stronger than the other, it causes movement or change in motion.

- Example: A tug of war where one team pulls harder.

---

## **4. What is Work?**

### **Definition:**

In science, **work is said to be done when a force is applied to an object and the object moves in the direction of the force**.

**Work is NOT done** if:

- No movement happens.
- Movement is not in the direction of force.

### **Examples of Work:**

- Pushing a trolley and it moves.

## **5. Stages of Crop Production**

Growing crops involves several steps. These are the main stages:

### **a. Preparation of Soil**

- Soil is ploughed to loosen it using tools like ploughs or tractors.
- Loosening soil allows air and water to reach roots easily.

### **b. Sowing**

- Seeds are planted either by hand or by seed drill machines.
- Quality seeds are selected for high yield.

### **c. Adding Manure and Fertilizers**

- **Manure**: Natural material from animal waste or plant remains.
- **Fertilizers**: Chemical substances rich in nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

### **d. Irrigation**

- Watering crops regularly is essential.
- Sources: Canals, rivers, wells, tube wells.
- Modern methods: Sprinklers and drip irrigation save water.

### **e. Weeding**

- Removing unwanted plants (weeds) that compete with crops for nutrients.
- Methods: Hand-pulling, using weed cutters, or spraying herbicides.

### **f. Harvesting**

- Cutting and collecting mature crops.
- Done using sickles or machines like combine harvesters.

### **g. Storage**

- Crops are dried and stored in silos, godowns, or granaries.
- Prevents spoilage and protects from pests.

## **7. Irrigation Techniques**

Providing water to crops is called irrigation. India has both traditional and modern methods.

### **Traditional Methods**

- **Pulley system (moat)**, **chain pump**, **dhone**, and **rahat**.
- Rely on human or animal power.

### **Modern Methods**

- **Sprinkler Irrigation**: Like artificial rain; best for sandy soils.
- **Drip Irrigation**: Water drops slowly to the roots; saves water.

## **8. Animal Husbandry**

Farming also includes taking care of animals. This is known as animal husbandry.

### **Common Farm Animals**

- **Cows and buffaloes**: Provide milk.
- **Goats and sheep**: Used for meat and wool.
- **Hens and ducks**: Provide eggs and meat.
- **Oxen and horses**: Used for ploughing and transportation.

Proper shelter, clean water, regular feeding, and veterinary care are essential.
