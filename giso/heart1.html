    <h2><strong>“The Beating Heart of Magic”</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The first rays of dawn stretched across the turrets of Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry. In the East Tower, Professor Liora Cardia
      prepared for her most anticipated lecture of the year —
      <em>Magical Anatomy: The Enchanted Heart</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Cardia was no ordinary witch. A former healer at St. Mungo’s and
      now Hogwarts’ Magical Biology professor, she was known for turning the
      most mundane lessons into dazzling adventures. Today’s topic, the human
      heart, pulsed with both magical and mortal significance.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 1: A Heartfelt Mystery</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Third-year Ravenclaw, Elio Thorne, hurried into the enchanted anatomy
      classroom, a satchel bouncing against his side. The walls of the room
      shimmered with floating diagrams of the human body, enchanted to pump and
      glow in real time. At the center stood a massive, golden model of a
      beating heart — not real, but astonishingly lifelike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elio slid into his seat beside his friend, Priya Patel, a Hufflepuff with
      a curiosity for everything under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll bring it to life again?&quot; Elio
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She always does,” Priya grinned. “She says the heart is the first magic
      we carry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, Professor Cardia swirled into the room, her robes embroidered
      with pulsating veins and tiny glowing arteries. With a flick of her wand,
      the lights dimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Welcome, young healers and heart-holders,” she began, her voice smooth
      and rhythmic. “Today we explore the most enchanting organ of all: the
      heart — not just the seat of emotion, but the very pump that sustains your
      body and, in some magical species, your spellcasting.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 2: The Four-Chambered Fortress</strong></h3>
    <p>
      With a gesture, the golden heart floated into the air and expanded until
      it was the size of a Hippogriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The heart,” Professor Cardia continued, “is divided into four chambers.
      Who can name them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Priya raised her hand immediately. “Right atrium, right ventricle, left
      atrium, left ventricle!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brilliant!” Cardia smiled, tapping her wand on each chamber. With every
      touch, they glowed red or blue depending on whether they carried
      oxygen-rich or oxygen-poor blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These chambers work in pairs. The right side handles the dirty work —
      receiving oxygen-depleted blood from the body and sending it to the lungs.
      The left side handles the treasure — oxygen-rich blood from the lungs,
      pumped out to nourish every magical inch of you.”
    </p>
    <p>Elio raised a hand. “Is that why veins look blue and arteries red?”</p>
    <p>
      “Exactly,” said Cardia. “Though blood isn’t really blue. It’s the way
      light reflects off your skin. But in your body —”
    </p>
    <p>
      She snapped her fingers. A swirling illusion appeared, showing blood
      entering the <strong>right atrium</strong>, moving into the
      <strong>right ventricle</strong>, then flowing through the
      <strong>pulmonary artery</strong> to the lungs. Oxygen was added like a
      golden spark. The now-bright red blood returned to the
      <strong>left atrium</strong>, moved into the
      <strong>left ventricle</strong>, and burst out through the
      <strong>aorta</strong> like a firework.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is called <em>double circulation</em>,” she explained. “One loop
      goes to the lungs — <em>pulmonary circulation</em>. The other goes to the
      body — <em>systemic circulation</em>.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 3: The Magic Within</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Elio watched, fascinated. “How does it keep beating?” he asked. “Even when
      we sleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” Cardia said with a glint in her eye, “let me show you the magic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved her wand, and the heart split open to reveal a tiny glowing node
      at the top of the right atrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is the <em>sinoatrial node</em>, often called the
      <em>natural pacemaker</em>. It sends out electrical impulses — magical in
      their rhythm — that tell the heart when to contract. It keeps you alive.
      Even a Muggle’s heart works like this — it’s one of the few places where
      magic and nature speak the same language.”
    </p>
    <p>The classroom was quiet.</p>
    <p>
      Cardia went on, “This tiny node sends impulses through the atria — those
      are the two upper chambers — making them contract and push blood into the
      ventricles. Then another node, the <em>atrioventricular node</em>, carries
      the signal into the lower chambers, which then contract.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She flicked her wand again. A heartbeat thudded through the classroom,
      rhythmic and powerful:<br /><strong>Lub-dub. Lub-dub.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s the sound of your valves snapping shut,” she said. “The
      <em>lub</em> is the atrioventricular valves closing. The <em>dub</em> is
      the semilunar valves. They’re like magical doors, making sure blood
      doesn’t flow backward.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 4: A Pulse in Peril</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the golden heart flickered. The rhythm stuttered. Something was
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>“Professor!” cried Priya. “Is that supposed to happen?”</p>
    <p>Cardia frowned. “No, it isn’t.”</p>
    <p>
      A sharp <em>crack</em> sounded as a swirl of dark magic slithered through
      the classroom. A shadow creature — part mist, part heartbeat — emerged. It
      was a <strong>Pulse Wraith</strong>, a rare magical parasite that
      disrupted rhythms and invaded magical anatomy artifacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s feeding on the heart’s energy,” Cardia warned. “We need to restore
      its rhythm, or the model — and perhaps the lesson — will be lost.”
    </p>
    <p>Elio stood up. “How do we fix a disrupted rhythm?”</p>
    <p>
      Cardia smiled despite the tension. “A good question. Sometimes, with
      spells. Sometimes with potions. And sometimes…” She handed Elio a
      wand-like crystal. “…with a magical pacemaker.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 5: A Rhythmic Rescue</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Elio held the crystal as the golden heart flickered dangerously. The Pulse
      Wraith was wrapping its tendrils around the sinoatrial node.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Focus on the beat,” Cardia instructed. “Recall the rhythm: Lub-dub.
      Lub-dub. Guide the crystal’s pulse back into the node.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes. He could hear his own heart — fast with nerves, but
      strong. He pointed the crystal and whispered, <em>“Cardius Restora.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>The crystal pulsed with light. Slowly, it echoed the natural rhythm.</p>
    <p><strong>Lub… dub. Lub… dub.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The tendrils recoiled. The heart brightened. The golden chambers glowed
      red and blue once more. The Pulse Wraith screeched and vanished into a
      puff of dark mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applause broke out. Priya hugged Elio. Cardia placed a hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well done. You’ve just performed magical defibrillation — restoring the
      heart’s beat through energy alignment. Healing magic at its finest.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 6: The Heart&#39;s Duty</strong></h3>
    <p>With the heart stabilized, Cardia resumed her lesson.</p>
    <p>
      “Now you see, the heart isn’t just a muscle. It’s a sentinel. It beats
      over 100,000 times a day, pushing nearly 7,500 liters of blood through
      your vessels. It fuels your brain, your limbs, your magic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She conjured a glowing network of arteries and veins that filled the room
      like a starlit web.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Arteries carry blood away from the heart. Veins return it. Capillaries —
      tiny vessels — link them. It’s a circulation of life. And life, as you’ve
      seen, can be disrupted. That’s why understanding the heart is so
      important.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Chapter 7: The Emotional Current</strong></h3>
    <p>
      “Before we end,” said Cardia, “know this: your heart isn’t just a pump.
      Magical studies show it reacts to your feelings. Fear speeds it up. Love
      strengthens its rhythm. Some say strong emotions can leave magical
      imprints on the heart.”
    </p>
    <p>She looked meaningfully at Elio and Priya.</p>
    <p>
      “Many ancient spells — Patronus, Shield Charms — draw from the heart’s
      emotional energy. That’s why learning to regulate your emotions is as
      vital as wand technique.”
    </p>
    <p>A silvery stag, Cardia’s Patronus, galloped around the classroom.</p>
    <p>
      “Your heart is your ally. Treat it with care, and it will carry you
      through every challenge — magical or mortal.”
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Epilogue: The Legacy of a Beat</strong></h3>
    <p>
      That night, as Elio sat by the Ravenclaw common room window, he placed a
      hand on his chest. The beat was steady — strong. He thought of the golden
      heart, the Pulse Wraith, and how close they’d come to losing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized for the first time that every single thud inside him was a
      rhythm older than magic, older than wands — the very pulse of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the world of spells and potions, flying brooms and talking portraits,
      the most magical thing of all might just be something you carry in your
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>A heart — beating, unwavering, and utterly enchanted.</p>
